<a name=1_1></a> <br/> <b>2 -1 – 1.1 Introduction </b> <br/>Hello.  <br/> <br/>Welcome to the first week of this course on terrorism and counter-terrorism comparing theory and <br/>practice. In the following videos we're going to look at how terrorism has made headlines in the past <br/>decades, the definition problem and the essence of terrorism. Let us first have a look at the facts. We <br/>hear about terrorism almost every day and it's a truly global phenomenon. Leaving more than 10,000 <br/>people dead according to the statistics of the United States State Department. But not all parts of the <br/>world are as much troubled by terrorism as others. Let's have a closer look at the exact numbers. For <br/>you see Afghanistan, number one on the list, with more than two and a half thousand people killed <br/>because of terrorist activities. Closely followed by Iraq, with about the same number of people dead. <br/>Pakistan is very high. Nigeria and even Russia, number five on the list, suffered from more than 650 <br/>people killed because of all types of attacks. What about other countries? What about the biggest <br/>countries in this world? China, India, United States Brazil and European Union.  <br/> <br/>If we look at European Union, for instance, we see that Europe’s law enforcement agencies said that, <br/>in 2012 17 people died as a result of terrorist activity in the European Union. That's seventeen too <br/>many, but it's a very low number if we compare that to countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq <br/>And the same holds for the United States. According to the statistics of the US State Department, 10 <br/>US citizens were killed in terrorist activity, all of them in Afghanistan and none of them on US <br/>territory. And India, of the biggest countries in this world. They face quite a lot of terrorism and Have <br/>a pretty high number of people killed because of terrorism. Sadly more than 200 of them were killed <br/>in terrorist activities. And China, the biggest country has 15 People killed in terrorist activities in the <br/>year 2012. And I'm happy to say that Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, has zero casualties <br/>because of terrorism. Let us know have a look at the graph with all the ten countries that I <br/>mentioned, and you immediately see the enormous difference between the top five. Afghanistan, <br/>Pakistan etcetera and the United States, Brazil, China and the EU. These differences are quite big. <br/>Well, let's put it on a map.  <br/> <br/>The map of terrorism today shows the differences in the impact of terrorism. Well the map was <br/>made by the Institute for Economics and Peace, and it combines the number of incidents, fatalities, <br/>injuries and property damage. And it's based on the data of the global terrorism data base of <br/>Maryland University. What do you see? You see hot, hotspots in South Asia and in Middle East, <br/>Russia, Northern Africa, but unfortunately also see that many parts of Asia, Southern Africa, America <br/>and European Union are not that frequency troubled by terrorism. In many countries, also the ones <br/>where terrorism doesn't happen that often, it ranks high on national political agendas. But the same <br/>holds for the international agenda. large organizations like the UN and NATO and other regional <br/>organizations. Have been focusing on terrorism a lot, especially since 911.  <br/> <br/>In many countries, terrorism is considered the biggest, or one of the biggest, threats influencing <br/>relationships between countries and between communities. And some may even argue that we live <br/>in a post nine eleven world, because of its enormous impact. On relationships on a way of thinking <br/>about security. Do you agree?  <br/> <br/>Well, it's been 12 years. And there are so many other issues that define our age. Think of the <br/>economy, the environment, Technological innovations, and so many other social-political issues. A <br/>post 911 world? I wouldn't call it like that.  <br/> <br/>So what have we learned? Terrorism is a worldwide phenomenon. But there are enormous regional <br/>differences. And terrorism has a great impact on peace and security. And therefore some believe that <br/>we live in a post 9/11 world. In the next video, we're going to look at the history of terrorism. The <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_2></a>terrorism before 9/11.  <br/> <br/><b>2 – 2 – 1.2 History of terrorism </b> <br/>In the previous video we looked at the facts and the map of terrorism and its victims. In this video <br/>we're going to look at the history of terrorism. Non state actors using terrorism. It’s not really new. <br/>Even in pre-modern days, there were groups and individuals that used political violence against the <br/>authorities and elite. Think of a group we now call The Assassins. Who in the late 11th century in the <br/>Middle East killed governors, political and military leaders in order to create alliances or as an act of <br/>retribution. So nothing new and yes they were to assassinate something or somebody, stems from a <br/>group which we now would label a terrorist one. But most descriptions of modern day terrorism <br/>starts with the anarchists that are associated with the propaganda of the deed from the French <br/>propaganda par le fait. A group or network or movement that was active since the 1870s, 1880s. <br/>Another slogan associated with the early, modern day terrorism, is the slogan [FOREIGN], from the <br/>internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization that was fighting the Ottoman rule in the late <br/>nineteenth, early twentieth centuries. So even more than a century ago there were many different <br/>groups using different tactics, slogans and with different political backgrounds, ranging from the <br/>extreme left to nationalist separatists. And some killed heads of states and others attacked ordinary <br/>citizens. Some acted only in their home town or home region, while others had an international <br/>agenda and operated across borders.  <br/> <br/>So again, terrorism of today is nothing new. Some scholars that have looked into the history of <br/>terrorism have tried to find specific characteristics for certain eras or try to discover trends in <br/>terrorism. One of them is David Rapoport, he distinguishes four waves in terrorism. Each with its own <br/>ingredients, different audiences, sympathizers and supporters, or modus operandi, meaning the way <br/>these groups operate. Each of these periods or waves last about a few decades, three or four <br/>decades after which they gradually fade out.  <br/> <br/>The four waves are as follows. The anarchists in the 1880s are the first wave that is followed by an <br/>anti-colonial wave from the 1920s on. And this again is followed by a new left wave, what he calls a <br/>new left wave. You could also call it the, the red terrorism that started in the 1960s. And then finally, <br/>the fourth wave is the religious wave, which according to David Rapoport, started in the year 1979. <br/>Let's have a look at each of these waves, starting with the anarchists.  <br/> <br/>Well, according to David Rapoport that wave started in the 1880s, some say 1870s and it started in <br/>Russia. And from there on, it spread to other Parts of the world, Western Europe, America and also <br/>Asia. Well its, its founding fathers, you can say, were a number of Russian writers with their doctrine <br/>or strategy of terror. Bakunin and Kropotkin were the most famous ones. And they very much used <br/>the new technologies, new communication tools of their age, such as the telegraph and mass media <br/>in those days, newspapers. One of the most notorious organizations of that era is the Russian <br/>organization Narodnaya Volya. the name can best be translated as, the people's will. Well, members <br/>of that group killed, amongst others, a Russian tsar and in those days that was definitely breaking <br/>news. And according to David Rapoport these People call themselves terrorists and the 1890s has <br/>been described as the Golden Age of Assassination. Well it lasted from 1890s on also to the early <br/>twentieth century, and some of its victims were the Elizabeth, the Empress of Austria Uberto the <br/>first, King of Italy. And a US, a United States President. It was, and here you see a picture of the man <br/>President McKinley of the United States who was killed in Buffalo, the state of New York, and this <br/>picture is actually one Of the last pictures or the last picture taken of him.  <br/> <br/>The second wave of terrorism that is distinguished by David Rapoport is the wave of the anti-<br/>colonialists. What were their main characteristics? Well David Rapoport says it started in the 1920s. <br/>And it can be described as a struggle for self-determination, for independence, to liberate certain <br/>parts of the world. Former, well now, now former colonies from their occupiers, French rule, British <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_3></a>rule, etc. And the tactics these groups used were different from those in the previous wave and they <br/>used guerrilla tactics which was difficult for the powers, the British Empire, the French to deal with <br/>hit and run tactics. And some of these groups were quite successful in managing to, well almost <br/>defeat their opposing forces. Also very important is that, according to David Rapoport, these rebels <br/>stopped calling themselves terrorists and were beginning to use the term freedom fighters. So, they  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_4></a>were not terrorists. The terrorists were the other party. and they were fighting, they were struggling <br/>against what they would call government terror. Among the most well-known organizations of that <br/>wave are the IRA. The Irish Republican Army who from the 1920s on and a little bit earlier was <br/>fighting for an independent, a free Irish state and also a united one. And then another group that is <br/>linked to This anti-colonial wave is the FLN, the Front de Libération Nationale a group of Algerians <br/>who managed in the end to fight for an independent Algeria, who were fighting French rule. And <br/>then the third organization is Irgun, a militant Zionist group that was fighting the British authorities <br/>who at that time were governing what we now call Israel and Palestine. And here you see a picture of <br/>one of their most famous attacks, the attack on the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. Who, which at <br/>that time was the headquarters of the British mandatory authorities over Palestine.  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_5></a> <br/>The third wave of terrorism is what David Rapoport calls the new left wave. Or extreme left <br/>terrorism, the Red Brigades, the, the autonomi faction, and other groups that started in the 1960s. <br/>Well, some of its characteristics, first of all the Vietnam war that raged from the late 1950s on until <br/>the 1970s was a big driver for quite a number of groups especially also in Western Europe and North <br/>America. And David Rapoport observes the following. He says that many groups in the developed <br/>world including the Weather Underground, a group of students from North America, and autonomi <br/>in Germany saw themselves as vanguards for the masses of the Third World. And they probably <br/>would add the oppressed masses of the Third World.  <br/> <br/>Other groups include groups in Latin America, revolutionary groups who used urban guerrilla to fight <br/>the authorities, governments and partly were supported by the Soviet Union and its allies. Again <br/>don't forget also the context of this wave, of course it's the context of the Cold War. And at the <br/>international level, the International terrorism of those days is very much associated with <br/>Palestinians and in particular the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the PLO of Yasser Arafat. And <br/>the modus operandi the techniques, the tactics, they, the terrorist organizations of those they used <br/>were hostage takings and hijackings.  <br/> <br/>Well, the example of a hostage taking, an example I'm sure that all of you know, is the hostage taking <br/>of Israeli athletes during the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972. That event, and in particular also the <br/>Hostage taking, was watched by millions around the globe. The organization behind it was called <br/>Black September, and unfortunately it ended with all the athletes being killed, partly in an attempt to <br/>liberate them. The hijackings of those days were especially aimed at planes. Here you have a number <br/>of pictures of them planes from various, mainly western airliners were hijacked. And the main goal <br/>was to get attention for a certain cause, or to press free some of the co-fighters of the terrorists. And <br/>in those days most of them who had been hijacked in planes managed to get out of it alive as the <br/>intention of the terrorists was not to kill these people. But to use them as a tool to create, to get <br/>attention or to press governments to do something.  <br/> <br/>The fourth and last wave distinguished by David Rapoport is what he calls the religious wave, that <br/>started in 1979. The year of the Islamic revolution in Iran. The year the Soviet Union invaded and <br/>occupied Afghanistan in 1979 was also the year of the storming and occupation of the Grand Mosque <br/>in Mecca. Well, David Rapoport shows that there were many different religious groups that produced <br/>terrorism since 1979. he mentions Islam, many Islamic group but also the Sikh who from Punjab from <br/>their holy center, their holy temple, the golden temple in Amritsar, were for instance fighting the <br/>Indian authorities. But it also includes Jewish religious terrorists. Think of the murderer of Yitzhak <br/>Rabin who Was killed in 1995 while giving a speech in Tel Aviv. Well here you see the memorial site <br/>to Remember that event and to remember the Israeli Prime Minister.  <br/>But the religious waves also includes Christian groups think of anti-abortion militants who have killed <br/>quite a number of people and it also includes sects. And the most well-known attack of one sect Is <br/>the attack on the Tokyo subway by the Aum sect. Let me try to pronounce it in Japanese the Aum <br/>Shinrikyo sect who was responsible for an attack with unconventional weapons. The nerve gas sarin <br/>in which they tried to kill quite a few people. In the end, they managed to kill 12 and injure more <br/>than a thousand. Well here you have a picture of that event which according to many, is one of the <br/>first and most well know attacks with WMD, weapons of mass destruction. Well, fortunately they  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_6></a>didn't manage to create a mass destruction. But unfortunately quite a number of people were <br/>injured and a number, 12 of them killed.  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_7></a> <br/>Other characteristics of this wave includes the modus operandi of, of these religious groups. And like <br/>in earlier waves, its assassinations of key leaders the military representatives of states, as well as <br/>hostage takings, and new is the suicide bombing. it's associated with this wave especially the first <br/>attacks by the Lebanese militant Shiite organization called Hezbollah attacks on the US and French <br/>military forces in Lebanon. where they used trucks with suicide terrorism, blew up the headquarters <br/>of the Americans and the French.  <br/> <br/>But at the same time I should stress that suicide bombings also happened among non-religious <br/>groups. The Kurdish workers parties, a Mao separatists group in Turkey, as well as the Tamil Tigers <br/>who were trying to liberate or create autonomy for the Tamils on the island of Sri Lanka, in the state <br/>of Sri Lanka. And of course the groups that are associated with this wave include Al Qaeda. That is <br/>first mentioned and, and first, for the first time making headlines with its attack on the US Embassies <br/>in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi and here you see A picture of the devastation after the attack in Dar es <br/>Salaam. Al Qaeda associated with this particular fourth wave of terrorism. So according to David <br/>Rapoport, there are four waves of terrorism. That each lasts about a few decades after which they <br/>might be still there but attract a lot less sympathizers and supporters and gradually fade out. That <br/>leaves us with a very interesting question. If this is true, what would be the fifth wave of terrorism? <br/>I'm sure a lot of policy makers would like to know, so they can either prepare for it, or try to prevent <br/>any new wave. I'm very interested in your opinion about this. Please help me out by filling in this <br/>questionnaire.  <br/> <br/>In sum, the phenomenon of groups and individuals using terrorism is not new. There are examples of <br/>pre-modern times and Modern day terrorism has at least four different waves. In the next video <br/>we're going to look at the use of the word terrorism. What does it mean? How has it been used in <br/>different times and in different languages?  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_8></a><b>2– 3 – 1.3 Use of the word terrorism </b> <br/>In the previous video we looked at the history of terrorism. And in this video we're going to explore <br/>the use of the word terrorism. The English word terrorism is used a lot. And I've mentioned already <br/>earlier that, It makes headlines on almost a daily basis worldwide. But of course the term is used in <br/>many different languages. Well here are some examples of headlines of terrorist incidents in leading <br/>newspapers.  <br/> <br/>Let’s now first have a look at the use of the word terrorism at different times. Certain violent acts or <br/>attacks, that we today might label as terrorists were called something else in other times. To give you <br/>an example of the attack or assassination of the 25th United States President McKinley in 1901 <br/>already referred to it in a previous video. What did the newspapers say the next day? Well, here we <br/>have and example of the Philadelphia Record, a journal that doesn't exist anymore. and that refers to <br/>this attack by simply stating President McKinley is shot twice by Anarchist. By the way at that time he <br/>was still alive. He died only a few days later. And it also reads Washington is stunned by the blow. in <br/>addition to that it gives very interesting information. You see a graph an info graph of that age. <br/>Showing where he was hit. But you'll, if you read the whole page you will not find the word terrorist. <br/>So different times, different words to describe events, which I think today the killing of a US <br/>President, who would definitely call a terrorist attack.  <br/> <br/>And then there are differences in languages. In my language for instance Dutch, the word terrorism is <br/>translated as terrorisme. Well as you can hear, it hardly differs from the English word. But I'm sure <br/>there are many other languages where terrorism, when translated, sounds very different. And also <br/>might have a different meaning. Well here's two questions I would like you to have a look at. What <br/>about your mother tongue, if it’s not English. How would you translate the English words into your <br/>language, and does it still have the same meaning? And in the second question, what about other <br/>terms in English that can be used instead of the word terrorism. Well here's a questionnaire to <br/>explore these differences. Thank you for filling out the questionnaire. I'm looking forward to learn <br/>about.  <br/> <br/>The translation of terrorism in different languages and the synonyms for terrorism. But that brings <br/>me to an important question. How to describe, or define, the term? What does, for instance, the <br/>Oxford Dictionary, say about the meaning of the term. And I've used the Oxford Dictionary because, I <br/>think, it's the leading one in the English language. Let's have a look. It reads as follows, and I've used <br/>the online version. It says, terrorism is the unofficial and unauthorized use of violence and <br/>intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. It's a great dictionary. But as with all dictionaries, a <br/>description of words is an interpretation. And you and I might disagree about the interpretation they <br/>give for the word terrorism. Let's go back and have a second look at it. Again, it reads. Terrorism is <br/>the unofficial or unauthorized use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. Do we <br/>agree on this definition? I guess not. I think there's no consensus that this definition is the definition <br/>of terrorism. There's also a lack of consensus among scholars, policy-makers, politicians, experts. In <br/>fact, there's much dispute about how to define the term. Much disagreement also among scholars.  <br/>So what did we learn? The English word terrorist. Is used a lot, but it has different meanings in <br/>different times, and in different languages and as much dispute about how to define it to him. In fact, <br/>there is no generally accepted definition of terrorism. Why is that the case? That we're going to <br/>explore in the next video.  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_9></a><b>2 – 4 - 1.4 Why no generally accepted definition? </b> <br/>In the previous video, we discovered that the word terrorism can have many different meanings. And <br/>that there's a dispute about how to define the term. In this video, we're going to look into the <br/>reasons why it's so difficult to formulate a generally accepted definition of terrorism. And it's <br/>difficulties are best explained by Alex Schmid, one of the leading scholars in the field of terrorism and <br/>counter-terrorism studies. And he provides us with four reasons explaining difficulties in defining <br/>terrorism. Let's have a look at these four reasons.  <br/> <br/>Schmid notes that terrorism is a contested concept, and political legal social science and popular <br/>notions are often diverging. And the second reason is that the definition question is linked to <br/>legitimization and delegitimization and criminalization of certain groups. And the third reason why <br/>it's so difficult to get to a generally accepted definition is that, there are many different types of <br/>terrorism, each with a different form of manifestation. And finally, the fourth reason is that the Term <br/>has undergone changes in meaning, in more than 200 years of its existence. Well let us now look at <br/>each of these four reasons.  <br/> <br/>So terrorism is a contested concept.  <br/> <br/>What does that mean? I think it's best explained by looking at The phrase, one man's terrorist is <br/>another man's freedom fighter. Well, here you see six faces of persons that are associated with <br/>terrorism or freedom struggle, or other types of political violence by non-state actors. Do you <br/>recognize any of them? On the top row, from left to right, you see the face of Yasser Arafat, the <br/>leader, or the former leader of the PLO, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, who has been <br/>considered a terrorist by some, but who also holds a Nobel Peace Prize. And in the middle you see <br/>the face of Abdullah [UNKNOWN], the leader of the Kurdish worker's party, the PKK, from Turkey, <br/>who is regarded an arch enemy by the Turkish authorities. He's also in jail, but he's also considered a <br/>hero by many people with a Kurdish background. A hero, a freedom fighter. And on the right hand <br/>side, you see the face of Osama bin Laden, the former leader of Al-Qaeda. In the row below, you see, <br/>first of all the left-hand side, a picture of Che Guevara, a revolutionary left-wing activist, militant, <br/>terrorist, freedom fighter. Many labels you could use. In those days, in the 50s and 60s, very few <br/>would call him a terrorist. They would maybe label him as a revolutionary, as a rebel. But today, I <br/>think many people would label it quite differently if he would do these kind of things today. And then <br/>in the middle, you see the face of leader of the Tamil Tigers, you see also the flag with the tiger on it. <br/>the former leader, I should say. He has been killed a couple years ago. and he was the leader of an <br/>organization that was fighting the Sri Lankan authorities with the aim to create an independent state. <br/>Some would say a classical example of separatist nationalist terrorist, others might say freedom <br/>fighter. And then on the right hand side, you see the face of Anders Breivik, the man who killed <br/>almost 80 people in Norway a couple of years ago. With a right-wing anti-Islam ideology, what is he? <br/>A terrorist? A freedom fighter? Something else?  <br/> <br/>The second reason of Alex Schmid is related to the process of delegitimisation and criminalization of <br/>certain groups. A good example of this is putting certain groups on lists of designated terrorist <br/>organizations. Which means that if you are on such a list, you're considered a criminal organization <br/>with a wide range of consequences. It ranges from freezing the assets of the organization to possible <br/>arrests of its membership. The United Nations has such a list, and so do amongst others, the United <br/>States and the European Union.  <br/> <br/>Well, here you have the example of the United States and the European Union. Have a look at it. <br/>We'll make sure that there's also a list provided on the course dashboard. And you see that it has a <br/>wide range of groups. you can see Al Qaeda on it, the earlier mentioned Kurdish Workers' Parties, <br/>the Aum Shinrikyo from Japan, as well as the Tamil Tigers. Repeatedly, there's pressure upon <br/>Governments and international organizations to put a certain group on a list or to de-list another. <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_10></a>Well, the latter is much less frequent than the lobby of all kinds of groups and politicians to add a <br/>certain group on a certain list.  <br/>Well, one organization that has been confronted, repeatedly confronted with calls to be put on the <br/>EU list of designated terrorist organizations is the Lebanese organization Hezbollah, a Shiite  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_11></a>militant group and political party. People who are in favor of this point at The alleged involvement in <br/>violent activities by Hezbollah in and outside Lebanon. They point for instance at a terrorist attack on <br/>Israeli tourists in Bulgaria. And also point at the fact that Hezbollah is allegedly involved in all kinds of <br/>violence in the Middle East, including Syria. In July 2013, as a result of this pressure, The European <br/>Union decided to put the military wing of Hezbollah on its list of designated terrorist organizations. <br/> <br/>The third explanation for a lack of generally excepted definition of terrorism is the fact that there are <br/>many types of terrorism, each with a different form and manifestation. Well, here you see a list of <br/>Europol. European Union's law enforcement agency that distinguishes five different groups, based on <br/>ideology. They talk about religious inspired terrorism, which is distinct from ethno-nationalist and <br/>separatist terrorism. And then you have left wing and anarchist groups, as well as right wing groups. <br/>And then the fifth category is what they call single issue. Certain groups or individual that actually <br/>fight for one thing. For instance, that they fight for animal rights or they fight against abortion. A list <br/>based on ideology. Well, what about individuals with no clear ideology? Unfortunately, in the <br/>Netherlands, we have been confronted with a person who drove this car into a crowd, killing several <br/>people. Because he wanted to attack the queen who was visiting a town in the Netherlands. And his <br/>last words were, I did it on purpose. William Alexander, who is currently our king, he said, he's a <br/>fascist. He's a racist. And I knew the Queen would be there. How to label such an incident? Terrorism <br/>or not? And what about states? Why is state terrorism not one of the categories of Europol? We'll <br/>come back to that important question later on.  <br/> <br/>The fourth reason why it's so difficult to define terrorism, is the fact that the word has undergone <br/>changes in meaning in the more than 200 years of its existence. The term terrorism has changed its <br/>semantic focus several times. And it was originally used to describe the Reign of terror by the <br/>authorities after the French Revolution. And the term terrorist was not used in anti-government <br/>sense before the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century. And we already gave the <br/>example of the assassination of President McKinley. In the newspapers the next day they didn't use <br/>the word terrorism. And then today, I think it would be unthinkable that the killing of the United <br/>States President would not be labeled as a terrorist act. Now think of the reactions after the attacks <br/>on 9/11, here you see a number of examples. The word used in the headlines of the new, <br/>newspapers the following day included a wide variety of words: war, attack, infamy. But above all the <br/>words: terror and terrorism.  <br/> <br/>These examples show the changes in meaning of the word terrorism in its 200 years of existence. <br/>And it makes sense, because also terrorism itself, the act has changed. The nature and the face of the <br/>phenomena are also profoundly different from, let's say, 200 years ago. Why is there no generally <br/>accepted definition of terrorism? Alex Schmidt gave four reasons. Terrorism is a contested concept, <br/>and it's linked to the delegitimization and criminalization of certain groups. And then there are many <br/>different types of terrorism.  <br/> <br/>And finally, the meaning of the word has undergone changes in more than 200 years of it's existence. <br/>In the next video, we're going to argue why it's so important to have a definition of terrorism, and <br/>look at a number of attempts to arrive at one.  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_12></a><b>2 - 5 – 1.5 Need for a definition, some attempts </b> <br/>In the previous video we explained why it is so difficult, to arrive at a definition of terrorism, and in <br/>this video we're going to explore the need for a definition. And also we're going to look into attempts <br/>to arrive at generally accepted definition of the term. So we know it's very difficult to arrive at a <br/>generally accepted definition. But still I think we should try. Why, why is it so important to have a <br/>definition? Well here are a number of reasons.  <br/> <br/>We need a definition if we want to arrive at successful international cooperation in the fight against <br/>terrorism. Terrorism is a cross border phenomenon, and that means that we have to be able to share <br/>data and that means that we have to have some level of agreement. Who are we fighting? What <br/>constitutes a terrorist group or not? We already mentioned a problem of the listing of certain groups <br/>on a list of designated terrorist organization. It would be nice if we agree on what groups should be <br/>on that list or not. That would allow, for instance, the Sharing of data or the extradition of suspects. <br/>It's very difficult if country a says this is not a terrorist group. And the other one wants a certain <br/>person to be extradited and persecuted in another country. So, a higher level of agreement on the <br/>definition would improve international cooperation.  <br/> <br/>Also from a legal perspective there's another reason why we need some agreement on what is <br/>terrorism and what not, and to have quite precise definitions of terrorism. And that is what many <br/>human rights organizations call the risk of abuse. A lack of a definition, or proper one, is what they <br/>call an invitation to abuse. They say that in countries with no legal definition or rather vague ones it <br/>might be very tempting for governments, especially for governments of a more authoritarian nature. <br/>To use the label of terrorism to silence all kinds of opposition using terrorism charges to arrest or <br/>convict people or protest radicals who have no intentions to use political violence. And human rights <br/>organizations, Human Rights Watch for instance repeatedly expressed concern. of the tendency of <br/>some governments to re, regard terrorism a wide range of conduct far beyond what is generally <br/>understood by that term. And to define terrorism in law using very broad and open ended languages. <br/>so there are sometimes definitions of terrorism, but it's so fake that it's very difficult to label <br/>somebody a terrorist, heretical, or let's say a democratic protester. Countries make use of that or <br/>misuse of that, and a good definition could help to avoid that.  <br/> <br/>There's also a need for a proper or generally accepted definition of terrorism among researchers. We <br/>are very often confronted with different definitions, and try to make sense or give a general picture <br/>about developments with regard to terrorism, trends in terrorism. And I gave you the example of the <br/>number of casualties in recent years. I showed you data of United States State Department, but I also <br/>used Europol, for instance as a sore, source and the global terrorism database. Well, each of them <br/>have a slightly different definition of terrorism, and I added them up to give you a general picture. I <br/>think it's okay, for a general picture. But what if I add that? And I would like to make a proper <br/>analysis of trends in terrorism. And add more of these data with different sources. How solid are my <br/>statements? I think they're problematic, to say the least. The challenge, a lack of definition poses to <br/>international corporations, was one of the reasons why Kofi Annan, then Secretary General of the <br/>United Nations, actually from 1997 to 200 tried to achieve a consensus about what is terrorism or <br/>what not.  <br/> <br/>Well let's see how he tried in the end. Unfortunately, how he also failed. He tried to reach consensus <br/>about a definition that focused on the targeting and the deliberate killing and non-combatants. For <br/>political purposes. But this definition did not gain the support of all member states. Although you <br/>might say, well what's harmful about a definition that focuses on the killing of civilians and non-<br/>combatants who can't be against them? More or less, it was difficult. And then also in a report <br/>entitled Uniting Against Terrorism recommendations for global counter-terrorism strategy. You'll find <br/>a copy on the course dashboard.  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_13></a>We've tried with the document to send out the moral message that terrorism is unacceptable and <br/>unjustifiable. Again, that sounds pretty decent to say, but not all states saw this as a sound basis for <br/>moving forward. Why not? Some revive the ideas about foreign occupation, and state terrorism that <br/>in their eyes Justified violence that they didn't want as, regard as or being  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_14></a>labelled as terrorism. And also think back at Second World War or a number of countries that face an <br/>illegal occupation, it makes sense that people have that in mind. Might be very much against <br/>something that is called unacceptable and unjustifiable under all conditions. So a number states were <br/>against that. And in the end, the attempt also failed because some states did not want to hear <br/>anything. About a suggestion or a definition that did not explicitly exclude state terrorism, meaning <br/>the idea that states could be labelled as terrorist. If they used terrorist tactics against other <br/>governments or their population or against their own population. So he courageously tried. But <br/>unfortunately, he failed. What about state terrorism? What do you think?  <br/>Well I guess I'm going to disappoint a few of you because personally, I'm not so much in favour of <br/>labelling the violence by state authorities against other countries. Or the population of other <br/>countries, or their own citizens as terrorism. We have international law, humanitarian law, and a law <br/>of war. And it's rather label, use and misuse of violence by states and war crimes or abuse of power <br/>and do not like to call that terrorism. We have a lot of legal instruments, International instruments, <br/>that we can use to fight war crimes. Abuse of power. But there are no such legal instruments in the <br/>field of terrorism. That's why, I think, we should be very careful to use the term state terrorism, and I <br/>prefer not to use it. That means that in this course when we talk about terrorism, we talk explicitly <br/>about the use of political violence by non-state actors.  <br/> <br/>Again, I do understand that many of you disagree. But I hope we can agree to disagree. Let us now <br/>move onto academic attempts to arrive at a definition. Well the most often quoted attempt is that of <br/>Albert Jongman and Alex Schmid. In the 1980s, they sent out a questionnaire to leading scholars in <br/>the field of terrorism and counter-terrorism studies. And they asked them, write down your <br/>definition of terrorism. And when these questionnaires came back, they studied them and tried to <br/>find key components that many people seem to agree upon. And they arrived at 22 key components. <br/>And in 2011, Alex Schmid. Updated this version.  <br/> <br/>Again, we sent out a questionnaire and looked into the literature regarding the definition of <br/>terrorism. Have a close look at it, and take your time. These are 12 core components, and I would like <br/>to ask you a few questions about it. Which one do you think are more important? Which ones are <br/>less important? Maybe I should explain a few of them, but again have a look it for yourself. For <br/>instance, the first one, it says that a core component of definition of terrorism is that a definition <br/>should say something about, the fact that terrorism is both a doctrine and a practice. So it's both, <br/>both an idea, a doctrine and a practice something that happens on the ground. It should also refer to <br/>the context in which terrorism is employed as a tactic. Think of is it a war situation or not a war <br/>situation. These kind of context according to Alex Schmid. And others is an important key component <br/>of terrorism.  <br/> <br/>And then it also says that it should say something about the perpetrators, those behind terrorist <br/>attacks. Do you agree on that? Do you think that is a core component? Is it number one in your list or <br/>one of the last on your list? These kind of things I would like to know. But do you agree that a <br/>definition of terrorism should mention that terrorist acts form part of a campaign of violence, so not <br/>only one terrorist incident but a series of attacks. Do you think that's an important component or <br/>not? That's what I want to know from you. In the questionnaire, we're going to ask you, what are the <br/>most important core components? Which three of them do you think should be in any definition of <br/>terrorism?  <br/>So again, have a close look at these 12 components. And pick your three most important ones. I'm <br/>very much interested in your opinion about core elements in a definition of terrorism. And I also <br/>have a message for you from Alex Schmid who is the author of the academic consensus definition, <br/>that consists of these 12 parts.  <br/>So you're seeing that it can be quite difficult to arrive at a satisfactory definition of the concept of <br/>terrorism. It's a contested concept, like others, for instance, imperialism is a contested concept. <br/>Nonetheless, it is absolutely necessary that we talk about the same. Object rather than use vague <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_15></a>and broad terms. However in each country, the usage differs a little bit. And since you come from <br/>many countries, we would be very much interested how. The term terrorism is used in your country. <br/>Is it broadly applied, narrowly applied, Loosely applied, or confined to certain groups only?  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_16></a>So your collaboration in this would be very much appreciated. Thank you for filling out the <br/>questionnaire.  <br/>What did we learn, this video? We looked into the need for a definition. And also focused on two <br/>attempts. One by Kofi Annan, then Secretary General of the United Nations. And we looked at the <br/>academic consensus definition by Alex Schmidt. In the next video, we're going to focus on the <br/>essence of terrorism.  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_17></a><b>2 – 6 – 1.6 Essence of terrorism </b> <br/>The previous video showed a need for a definition of terrorism. And we have discussed several <br/>attempts to arrive at a generally accepted definition of the term. In this video we will explore the <br/>essence of terrorism.  <br/> <br/>Well, there is not one definition of terrorism and that's bad but there is general agreement that the <br/>phenomenon of terrorism has many different elements. And there's also more or less agreement. <br/>That terrorism is an instrument or a tactic of certain groups, be they non state actors or state actors, <br/>to achieve certain goals. Use of force is important, an important part of this instrument or tactic. But <br/>it's not its goal. Of course there are exceptions. Sometimes it's not clear what a terrorist wants and <br/>sometimes the violence in itself seems to be both a method and a goal. we call this expressive <br/>terrorism. There's no difference in, between method and goal. It's very unclear.  <br/> <br/>Well, fear finally, is one of the key components. And spreading fear is more important than spreading <br/>death. So it's not primarily about causing casualties. The goal is not many dead, but many afraid. And <br/>terrorists sometimes manage to do that with very limited means. Especially in countries that are not <br/>that often confronted with terrorism. An example of that is the situation in the Netherlands in the <br/>years 2005, 2006. In 2006, according to a public opinion Poll [FOREIGN]. 40% of the Dutch consider <br/>terrorism to be one of the two most important problems the country was faced with. And they were <br/>more afraid than the British and the Spanish, who had just experienced horrible attacks in Madrid, <br/>with 200 people being killed, and the London bomb, with more than 50 people killed.  <br/>So what happened in the Netherlands that they were so afraid of terrorism? Well, just one attack by <br/>one person Killing one other person, the Dutch filmmaker, Theo van Gogh. Well, one could argue that <br/>the killer managed to produce a lot of fear out of one single action. I guess too much fear. A well-<br/>known scholar that was one of the first to stress that terrorism is not primarily about killing people is, <br/>Brian Jenkins. In 1975, he wrote terrorists want a lot of people watching. Not a lot of people dead, <br/>and I agree. And I think this statement is still quite interesting today. Whether or not it's still very <br/>relevant given changes in terrorism, it's terrorism of today is different than the terrorism of 1975, we <br/>will discuss in a later video. Well.  <br/> <br/>The essence of terrorism is not only that it's not mainly about killing. Another important element is <br/>that the direct targets are not or only rarely the main targets. How to explain this? We take for <br/>instance the attacks on 9/11. 3000 people were killed, but they were in many ways the indirect <br/>targets. The, the terrorist didn't want to kill Those people, they wantd to attract a lot of attention. <br/>The main targets were you and I who were watching these horrible pictures of people being killed in <br/>New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.  <br/> <br/>So, the direct targets are not or only rarely the main targets of terrorism. So the violence is not aimed <br/>at those who die but those who continue to live. The main target is us. You and me. The terrorist <br/>strategy is to kill one or a few and to frighten millions. They want us to overreact, and unfortunately <br/>that is quite often the case. Maybe we should try harder not to be afraid, not to overreact. I'm very <br/>much a fan of the social movement and slogan, we are not afraid. People posting pictures or <br/>cartoons or using banners to express their resilience to terrorism, stating, we are not afraid.  <br/>Well, here you see a picture using the logo of the London Underground as a reaction to the 7/7 <br/>London bombings in 2005. But how hard you and I might try, the impact can, of terrorism, can <br/>sometimes be very high. Media are very important in spreading fear. But the same holds for <br/>politicians and public figures. And as a result of this spreading of fear. Terrorism and the impact of <br/>terrorism can be enormous, it is a big threat. Not in physical terms, although too many people die <br/>because of terrorism, but the impact is enormous. The impact can be very high on society, on <br/>relationships between communities. It can be very high on the economy and. On politics. There <br/>seems to be some level of agreement on the idea that terrorism is a tool, a mechanism, an <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_18></a>instrument to spread fear by the way of using violence. In order to impact politics and society. Well, <br/>unfortunately that impact is often enormous as politics and society tend to over react after terrorist  <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=1_19></a>incidents. And by doing so, we help the terrorists. And that's not a good idea. I'm very much a fan of <br/>the idea to show resilience to terrorism, and the slogan, we are not afraid.  <br/>What are we going to do next week? We will look at the study of terrorism and counterterrorism. <br/>We're going to answer the question, what does, what do academia and think tanks have come up <br/>with after 9/11? And why is it rather difficult to study terrorism? See you next week. <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2_1></a><b>2.1 History of terrorism studies <br/> <br/></b>Hi there, good to see you again. Last week we discussed among, amongst other things the definition <br/>of terrorism and the nature of the phenomenon. And in the forum I observed quite a number of <br/>different opinions about what constitutes terrorism and whatnot, and the same holds for the labeling <br/>of certain groups. Well here's the questionnaire to start with. We have these lists of terrorist <br/>organizations and I want your opinion on it.  What do you think of this kind of lists, and what do you <br/>think about certain groups? What groups should be on the list and aren't on any lists yet? Is that okay, <br/>or do you disagree with <br/>that? <br/>Take your time. Have a good look at it. It's important that, this questionnaire is part of our joint <br/>research effort that is an essential part of this course. Thank you for filling out the questionnaire, and <br/>I'm looking forward to see and analyze the results and share them with you in the forum. This week, <br/>we're going to look into the study of terrorism and counterterrorism. So what are we going to do this <br/>week? <br/>
Well, here's a list of topics that we're going to discuss. The History of Terrorism studies and <br/>
the disciplines and approaches. What scholars, what, different centers have produced many reports <br/>and studies that have been published in the last couple of decades. we're going to have a look at the <br/>names and faces of some of the key authors and where they conducted their studies. And then we're <br/>going to look at an important part and that's challenges and dilemmas. Well, doing social research, <br/>the social science research in general is, is difficult but studying terrorism is particularly difficult. <br/>Think about the problem of secrecy. <br/>
And finally, we got a look at the current state of the art. What key authors, key scholars said <br/>
about the quantity and quality of what has been produced in recent years. What else this week? For <br/>those who are going for the Certificate with distinction there is the peer reviewed assignment. For <br/>more information see the course syllabus. An then for everybody else there is, of course, the weekly, <br/>weekly quiz. <br/>
In this video we're going to look at the History of Terrorism and counter-terrorism studies. <br/>
Well terrorism is not new, an the same holds for, the study of this phenomenon. We're going to look <br/>at modern day terrorism. Meaning the terrorism that emerged in the late 1950s, early 1960s. So <br/>what did they focus on in those days? Well, they focused on, for instance, conflict Theory. Why do <br/>people fight each other? Why do they use violence? especially with the political science background <br/>they looked at the phenomenon, the new phenomenon offences decolonization, riots, violence. But, <br/>also riots and violence in Western European cities and North American cities. So the political violence <br/>in general was studied either under the name Terrorism Studies or Political Violence Studies. And the <br/>groups they looked at were anti-imperialist and revolutionary terrorist groups. And one of them was <br/>an organization called The Weather Underground that started on a campus in North America. And it <br/>can be labeled as Marxist, Leninist, left wing kind of Terrorism. In those days, I don't think they use <br/>that term. But, it's definitely something we would, label it now. And it's the start of a [UNKNOWN], a <br/>number of red terrorist groups that would dominate also very much the news in the 1970s. <br/>
The 1970s and 1980s saw much more attention to the modus operandi of terrorist groups. <br/>
the techniques, the methods they used to target selection. And the targets of those days were a lot <br/>of hijackings and hostage takings. Well, here's just a few examples of red organizations that were <br/>active in these times. So, people with a Marxist, Leninist background, extremist Left groups. here you <br/>see the logo of the Rote Armee Fraktion, which was active in Germany. If you want to know more <br/>about it, I can commend, recommend a number of books. But, I think my best recommendation <br/>would Be to watch the movie Bottom Line of Complex. A very interesting movie that shows you a bit <br/>of the context in which the group was operating those days. And also the motivations of some of the <br/>individual members to, to join that struggle. And also a lot of violence that was connected to that <br/>group. Bottom Line of Complex. Actually, if you want to learn more about tips for movies, you can <br/>find it on the course dashboard. <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2_2></a>You also see a picture here of, Alberto Moro. A key leader, politician in Italy who was <br/>
hijacked. Who was taken hostage by the Red Brigade in Italy. Again, a source for a lot of filmmakers <br/>to make a movie about, I can recommend Buongiorno, Notte, a very nice movie, that looks into the <br/>dilemmas also of those who were involved in taking, this man hostage. <br/>
And there's another movie I have over here, it's called Aldo Moro. Starring Michele Placido <br/>
one of the Leading movie stars in Italy. An excellent movie that also shows all the dilemmas of those <br/>who are fighting the Red Brigade and also the members of the group. In the end I think this particular <br/>hostage taking was disastrous for many people including the Red Brigade itself.  <br/>
And you see a picture of the Japanese Red Army. The Japanese Red Army yes. An active <br/>
group not only in Japan but actually just here 200 meters from my office there's the French Embassy. <br/>And they stormed that embassy in 1974. trying to press the release of one of their fighters. Actually, <br/>they managed to do so. And they managed to get away with it, on a plane. In in the end they <br/>managed to escape to Syria. <br/>
And that international connection was also something of great interest to researchers in <br/>
those days, the international dimension. The, the combination of Japanese Red Army And Palestinian <br/>groups attacking in Europe or in Singapore. It was really very international already in those days and <br/>of course researchers were very much interested in how this groups operated. In the 1990s as in <br/>previous decades, Scholars focused mainly on the, the topics of those days, the groups that were <br/>active, the way they staged attacks and the way government reacted to that. <br/>
And in the 1990s, these were the Nationalist Separatist Groups. Of course, they were active <br/>
also in the decades before that, but there was a lot of study, a lot of publications offering the IRA, the <br/>Irish Republican Army, fighting in the United Kingdom, and ETA, the Basque separatist group in Spain. <br/>But, also groups in India and Sri Lanka, the Tamil Tigers for instance. <br/>
Another type of terrorism that we're studying were what we call Islamist groups. It's a <br/>
difficult term, but let me label it as Islamist groups, as most scholars did in those days. And they were <br/>looking at, for instance, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the reaction of the Israeli and other authorities to <br/>those activities to new types of attacks, suicide attacks for instance. And there was also attention for <br/>the first time to a new group. Here you see a quote by the CIA. A quote that also appears in the <br/>report of the commission that looked into the terrorist attacks on 9/11. And the quote is from that <br/>report they're saying, the CIA noticed a recent stream of reports about bin Laden and something <br/>called al-Qaeda. That was in 1995 and a few years later there was a lot more attention to this group <br/>called, so-called group Al Qaeda. And it was after, you see a picture of it here, after the attacks on <br/>the US Embassies in Dar Es Salaam and Nairobi in East Africa. But in general, these 1990s saw a <br/>decline in academic interest. <br/>
We would not, we couldn't have known in those days that Al Qaeda, Islamist terrorism, and <br/>
other types of terrorism would be so dominant in the last 12 years. But, in those days, there was a <br/>decline in interest. Fewer and fewer scholars were focusing on terrorism as an interesting subject to <br/>study. But something called Al Qaeda received a Lot more attention after the biggest terrorist attack <br/>ever. The ones on 11 September 2001 where almost 3000 people were killed. Well that attack also is <br/>the starting point of an enormous growth in the field of terrorism and counter terrorism study. An <br/>enormous growth in terms of the number Of scholars and experts that were looking into this <br/>phenomenon. many of them, most of them today are post 9/11 researchers. I'm one of them. <br/>
Now, you also saw a number of new research centers being established. The Center of <br/>
Terrorism and Counter-terrorism at Landon Universities, for instance one of them. And you saw an <br/>enormous increase in training, policy advice and consultancy as governments wanted of course <br/>answers to all kinds of questions. Who was threatening us? Why? What can we do about it? How do <br/>we make sure that we don't do the wrong things and do the right things? All kinds of questions <br/>popped up. And scholars research centers try to Answer some of these questions and provide their <br/>services. And this resulted of course in enormous Growth of reports, books, articles, enormous <br/>growth in publications. <br/>
Here you see two graphs. one is a, a look at Amazon. The number of books with terrorism in <br/>
the title. you see that the number of titles, book titles, is more than doubled after 9/11. And don't <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2_3></a>forget, on the left hand side, You see, in blue, everything published, in the years before 9/11. And <br/>that means, in all the decades before 9/11. And then, after 9/11. Well, we're talking about 12, 13 <br/>years. So, an enormous growth in the number of Publications and the same holds for say more <br/>academic publications. If you look at Google scholar and look at the number of articles with terrorism <br/>in the title it's, it's more than, it doubled in 12 years’ time. <br/>
So what have we learned? We looked into the development of terrorism and counter-<br/>
terrorism studies starting in the early 1960s with just a handful of scholars. Then a growth in the <br/>1970s and 1980s. And a decline in the 1990s which was Followed by an enormous increase after the <br/>attacks on 9/11. In the next video were going to look at the various disciplines and approaches of <br/>research into terrorism and counter terrorism. <br/><b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2_4></a><b>2.2 Disciplines &amp; approaches <br/></b> <br/>&gt;&gt; In the last video, we discussed the history of terrorism studies. And in this video, we're going to <br/>look at the approaches and disciplines behind that term. I think it's safe to say that the phenomena <br/>of terrorism and counter terrorism have been studied by a wide variety of scholarly disciplines. <br/>
Well, here are just a few examples. Think of political science. scholars in that field are very <br/>
much interested where terrorism fits in in political systems, how it is maybe produced by political <br/>systems and how it influences that same system. How does terrorism have an impact on political <br/>processes, on decision making, on how governments act or react to terrorist incidents? <br/>
And then you have military science war studies. The term says it all. they're mainly interested <br/>
in the use of force, the use of the military to literately fight terrorism. <br/>
And then we have International Relations. Terrorism, at least for a long time, and in many <br/>
countries, is pretty high on national political agendas, but also on the international one. And scholars <br/>in the field of international relations want to know, who puts terrorism on the agenda and why. And <br/>what impacts the fight against Terrorism has, for instance, on relationships between countries. Does <br/>it lead to cooperation, or more conflict? These are just a few questions they are interested in. And <br/>then you have communication studies. Last week, we mentioned the fact that terrorism, to some <br/>extent, is a tool for terrorists to spread the word, to spread a message, to create fear, to have an <br/>impact on society. <br/>
Our scholars in the field of communication studies, want to know, how does that work? What <br/>
is the role of the media? how and what circumstances influence whether or not a country is turned <br/>upside down by a terrorist attack. Or how do you, how can you limit, for instance, the impact of <br/>terrorism on societies. <br/>
And then there's social psychology. You see a picture of a person that looks into the head of <br/>
somebody. Well, I'm not sure if psychologists like that idea, and they will definitely frame their <br/>domain differently. but it is of interest to people who study terrorism. There are quite a number of <br/>books that have in their title, the mind of the terrorist. We want to know what's going on up there. <br/>How do they think? How do they behave? Are they different from you and me? Or not? Are they <br/>crazy or not? We will discuss that also later.  What are their characteristics, and what about group <br/>processes. Who radicalizes, and who not. How to deradicalize persons. <br/>
All these are issues that are of importance in the fight against terrorism, in the struggle <br/>
against terrorism, and that are studied by people in the field of psychology and social psychology. But <br/>there are many more disciplines that study the phenomena of terrorism and counterterrorism. But <br/>here's a blurb with a number of them, arranging from conflict studies to international law, public <br/>administration, police science, actually there are too many disciplines to mention them all. And <br/>there's no dominant one, but I should Say that many scholars have a background in political science. <br/>
How to study and understand terrorism and Counterterrorism? Where to start approaching <br/>
this question? Are we going to look at the behavior of individuals? Or look at the larger picture, the <br/>world political system and how terrorism fits in. So we start very small or look at something very big. <br/>Are we going to talk to people? Approach them? Try to interview of terrorist and people that fight <br/>terrorism? Or are we going to look at the facts? Are we going to get our data? Look at, for instance, <br/>archives? And are we going to look at causes or the effects of terrorism? Just basic questions with <br/>different approaches, and each with different challenges and dilemmas, which we're going to focus <br/>on a little bit later. <br/>
So there are many different practical approaches to study terrorism and counter-terrorism, <br/>
but what about the theoretical ones? Well currently there are three main approaches. The first one is <br/>the rational or instrumental approach. This approach tries to understand terrorism and terrorists as <br/>rational actions, rational actors of people that want to achieve certain political goals. And their <br/>terrorist activities, their attacks, are an instrument to that. And are often the result of a cost-benefit <br/>analysis. <br/>
Here you see a picture of Martha Crenshaw, who was one of the early scholars that looked at <br/>
terrorism as a rational act and looked at terrorists as rational actors. The second main theoretical <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2_5></a>approach is that of social psychologists. And you see here a picture of Jerrold Post, who is one of the <br/>leading authors in this field, and we already mentioned some of the questions he and his colleagues <br/>like to address that are basically focused on the thinking and acting of individuals and that of smaller <br/>groups. And that's the main distinction with the rational or instrumental approach which focuses <br/>more on the wider political systems, political behavior and political processes. <br/>
The third main academic or theoretical approach is the multicausal approach. I'm not sure if <br/>
it's, a well-defined approach as most academics would fit in that category as there is wide spread <br/>understanding that terrorism is highly complex, and that there is not one single explanation for <br/>terrorism. And if you want to understand terrorism, you'll have to look at many different causes. Well <br/>I think I would fit in in that category. And I think we have to look in a wide variety of phenomenon <br/>and causes if we want to understand terrorism and counter terrorism. <br/>
To sum up, there are many different ways to study terrorism and counter terrorism. There <br/>
are many different disciplines Ranging from political science to police studies. And there are three <br/>main academic approaches: the rational instrumental approach, the social psychological approach, <br/>and a multicausal approach. Next time you read an article, try to find out the background of the <br/>author and the approach he or she takes in trying to understand terrorism. In the next video, we're <br/>going to look at the key authors and key centers of terrorism studies. <br/><b> </b><br/>

<hr/>
<a name=2_6></a><b>2.3 Key authors &amp; centres <br/></b> <br/>In the previous video, I already mentioned some of the leading authors in the field of terrorism and <br/>counterterrorism studies. And in this video, we're going to look at some other examples of key <br/>authors, very important centers and key journals in my area of expertise. Well, here is a list of some <br/>of the most well-known, most relevant, most often-quoted authors in the field of terrorism and <br/>counter-terrorism studies. <br/>
Have a look at the list. What do you notice? Look at the first names. You see very few ladies <br/>
among them. Ann Speckhard Jessica Stern, Martha Crenshel. We have already mentioned her and my <br/>colleague there [FOREIGN]. We'll come back to that later. <br/>
An interesting list of interesting people, and if you want to know more about them, I've <br/>
added a list of these people with their main publications on the course dashboard. The key research <br/>centers include, think tanks, NGOs and of course, many academic institutes that focus on terrorism, <br/>counter-terrorism, radicalization, etcetera. <br/>
Well, here are just a few places where I think the most prestigious centers are based. That's <br/>
in Washington D.C. and the surrounding area. Think of the University of Maryland, just outside the <br/>beltway. And downtown Washington, Rand Corporation. Well, it's in Arlington. Georgetown <br/>University, also not really downtown Washington. but Washington based centers are among the key <br/>centers in the field of terrorism studies. Same holds for London. Where you find quite a number of <br/>Universities and think tanks that focus on terrorism and counter-terrorism. And one that has done so <br/>for quite a while is based in Saint Andrews, all the way up in Scotland. where I think if I had to maybe <br/>pick one institute, it's maybe Saint Andrews, that is among the most prestigious ones. While outside <br/>Europe, outside America, you have an institute in Israel, Herzliya, and one in Singapore, which I <br/>would count among the leading ones in the field of terrorism and counter-terrorism studies. <br/>
Earlier I mentioned the enormous increase in terrorism studies and the establishment of <br/>
many new centers after the attacks on 9/11. Well, the Center of Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism of <br/>Lieden University is one of them. And together with the neighbors, the International Center for <br/>Counter-Terrorism, I believe that The Hague is one of the, the new institutes that also play a role in <br/>my field of study. And the same holds for a number of institutes in Scandinavia, Oslo, Stockholm. <br/>
Of course in Spain there is quite a lot of expertise centers in Madrid, and also more recent <br/>
phenomenon is the Center of Excellence of NATO on Terrorism in Ankara. And in Australia you have <br/>important centers of knowledge in Melbourne. <br/>
And I would also like to mention, one center in the United States that, has produced very <br/>
interesting results and much training, to people working in the field of terrorism. And that's the <br/>Oklahoma, center for Terrorism studies, which was established after the, the attack by Timothy <br/>McVeigh 1995 who blew up a building there, killing 150 people. And one of the, initiatives that came <br/>out of that attack was a center of excellence where people realized they needed to know more about <br/>terrorism. <br/>
Where do you find the main academic output of these research centers and individual <br/>
scholars? Well, of course increasingly on the internet, web logs, et cetera, but good old journals are <br/>still very important today, especially in the academic world. Well, here are the five leading ones in <br/>the field of terrorism and counterterrorism studies. From left to right and from oldest to Newest <br/>publication, you find Studies in Conflict and Terrorism. Then, next to it you find Intelligence and <br/>National Security. And in the middle, in blue, Terrorism and Political Violence. And then you to other <br/>one, you could say They are the most rebellious and the newest kid on the block. <br/>
So, Critical Studies on Terrorism. Offers a forum for a lot of writers, authors that have a <br/>
different view on the study of terrorism and maybe in particular on the way terrorism is dealt with by <br/>states. So it's a more critical journal, as the title already suggests. And then you find, the latest one, <br/>Perspectives on Terrorism, which is an open online journal, of which I'm very much a favor. Offering a <br/>platform for both many authors who can write and publish, but also a lot of readers who can freely <br/>access all these studies, interesting studies that are published in that journal. On the course <br/>dashboard, you'll find a link to these journals as well as to the centers that I mentioned earlier. When <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2_7></a>I presented the lists of authors in the field of terrorism, and counter-terrorism studies, I asked you if <br/>you noticed anything particular about that list. <br/>
Well let's now project that list on a map, as well as that of the centers and the journals. What <br/>
do you see? Do you see something remarkable? What about this statement? The study of terrorism <br/>and counter-terrorism is not only a real dominated discipline, but also a heavily western dominated <br/>discipline. My next question would be, is this a problem? And if so, why is this a problem? I would <br/>love to hear your opinion about this, by way of this next questionnaire. Thank you for filling out the <br/>questionnaire. I'm very curious about the results, which we're going to discuss online.  <br/>
How would I have answered that question? Well I do think that the study of terrorism and <br/>
counter-terrorism is a male dominated, Western dominated discipline. I mean look at the facts, look <br/>at them map, there's no way I'm denying it. Do I think it's a problem? Well, to some extent. About <br/>male dominance, I would like to give my dear friend and colleague, Professor Beatrice De Graaf, the <br/>opportunity to say something. She's the author of a very interesting book published in Dutch called, <br/>Dangerous Militant Women, and she Definitely has an interesting opinion on this. <br/>
 <br/>“Hi there. My name is Beatrice De Graaf. I'm a researcher at the Center of Terrorism and <br/>
Counter-terrorism here in The Hague. I'm a historian by training, so let's reflect a little bit on what <br/>Edwin Baucher said about male dominance in terrorism research, is that true? Well historically most <br/>often academic, scientific disciplines in the world do have a male dominance unfortunately enough. <br/>However, it might just be the case that in the terrorism research business, women are slightly on the <br/>march.  <br/>
There is some over representation compared to other disciplines of female engaging in <br/>
terrorism research. Take for example, Martha Krenshaw. She's one of the most famous terrorism <br/>researchers there is nowadays. She could be, considered the godmother of terror research from a <br/>historical perspective. She wrote the book Terrorism Context, which is still a seminal work for <br/>students to learn more about the histories, the origins of terrorism. <br/>
And there are a number of other female researchers who interviewed, who worked with, <br/>
female terrorists themselves and who wrote great, terrific books on female terrorism. For example, <br/>Mia Bloom wrote a book on female, the reasons why women engage in terrorism called Bombshell. <br/>And there is another book by Jessica Stern on suicide terrorism. but there is also an important study <br/>of Anne Speckhard of women engaged in, for example, Chechnya, Chechen war on terrorism. <br/>
So, just to round this point up. There is indeed male dominance in Terrorist research, but <br/>
women are on the march.” <br/>
 <br/>
  <br/>
What about western dominance? I do think that is a problem. There are too few non-western <br/>
scholars from Africa, Asia, Latin America. And if there's a resulted in much attention to terrorism in <br/>the west or against the west, a far less attention to terrorism elsewhere. And if we look at the map of <br/>terrorist incidents worldwide, we know that most terrorism takes place outside the western world. <br/>
And what about the study of counter-terrorism? If we look, for instance, at Pakistan, There is <br/>
much attention to counter-terrorism in Pakistan and how that can help us to increase safety and <br/>security in the Western part of the world. But what about the impact it has on Pakistan? What about <br/>what terrorism does, to Pakistan itself? There's far much less attention to that. <br/>
And think about this statement about labeling terrorists. Here you see a picture of a man <br/>
who killed a number of people in a cinema near Denver. And the statement here says, I shot, what, <br/>71 people and killed 12 of them. And it reads, if I were a Muslim they would of called me a terrorist. <br/>What do the makers of this statement want to show? What do they want to hint at? And do you <br/>agree with that? I'm not sure. But I do think that western media, society, and scholars, might be a bit <br/>biased when it comes to labeling terrorism, especially when Muslims are involved. Summarizing this <br/>video, we've seen that most office in the field of terrorism and counter-terrorism studies, are either <br/>based in North America or in Europe. <br/>  <br/>
Well, this Western bias has some negative implications for research. And it's good to be <br/>
aware of that. Hopefully this will change in the years to come. In the next video, we're going to <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2_8></a>discuss some of the practical challenges and dilemmas, when doing research on terrorism and <br/>counter-terrorism. <br/><b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2_9></a><b>2.4 Challenges &amp; dilemmas <br/></b> <br/>So now we know more about the history of terrorism studies. The main disciplines and approaches. <br/>And we also mentioned a number of names of persons and institutes that research terrorism, and <br/>counter-terrorism. I can assure you that all these scholars and experts find it difficult to study these <br/>phenomena. Why is this the case? What challenges and dilemmas are they confronted with? <br/>
Well, here is an overview of the main difficulties.  On the left you see a list of some of the <br/>
main difficulties. Well, last week we discussed a problem of definitions, and the lack of one is an <br/>obstacle in doing research on terrorism. For instance comparative research. How can I compare your <br/>results of a study On terrorism with my results, if we don't use the same definition. And we're <br/>comparing maybe apples and oranges. A lack of a definition is a problem in doing research. <br/>
The second difficulty for research is the fact that terrorism is subjective and politicized. Think <br/>
for instance about researching counter-terrorism. There you have to rely on reports by governments, <br/>by agencies that deal with terrorism, and of course they have a political agenda. Their vision on <br/>terrorism might be different than yours, and you have to be aware of the fact that there is a political <br/>agenda behind it. And that has of course an impact of, on the usability of these kind of report. And <br/>then there is the problem of small numbers. It's a bit difficult to explain. How can small numbers in <br/>terms of terrorism constitute a problem? Of course we should be happy about the fact that in many <br/>parts of the world, there isn't that much terrorism. But it for researchers it's, it's partly difficult, <br/>because it's easier and, and it's easier to come up with very general statements, to come up with <br/>theories, if the numbers are high. Then you have a lot of cases and you can say more precisely why <br/>people join terrorist group, or why they use a certain tool. This is not the case for terrorism. The <br/>numbers are low, but let's be happy about that. <br/>
Number four on the list of main difficulties in doing research on terrorism and counter-<br/>
terrorism, is the fact that these are very complex phenomena and that they're changing all the time. <br/>The terrorism and counter-terrorism of Today looks quite different from that of let's say a couple of <br/>decades ago. But the most challenging problem, dilemma. The most important difficulty in doing <br/>research on terrorism and counter-terrorism is secrecy. How to deal with the secrecy that surrounds <br/>both terrorism and counter-terrorism. <br/>
How about learning about the actors involved? How to understand their motivations, why <br/>
they do things, how they organize things with all that secrecy that surrounds it? Think also about the <br/>names of many of these actors. We have intelligence services, but we're mainly refer to them as <br/>secret services, and we have secret agent. And the same holds for terrors, or terrorists or terrorist <br/>organizations. They also sometimes have names that indicate that secrecy. I already referred to the <br/>Weather Underground. Well, or actors with these names, and all that secrecy involved is of course a <br/>big obstacle in doing research. For instance, how to interview these people. What about the <br/>opportunities to do so, which is standard practice in social research. And you want to know more <br/>about people, you knock on their door and you ask if you can have an interview. Well, that's very <br/>difficult in terrorism and counter-terrorism studies. <br/>
And what about participant observation, meaning that you join a certain actor for a while. A <br/>
counter-terrorism agency or a terrorist Organization because you want to know what's going on <br/>there. Well, I think the chances that you will be allowed to do that are very, very small. The same <br/>holds for trying to get much information from the police and secret services. I tried to get access to <br/>files and archives, especially with very sensitive oper, operational information. It's, the chance that <br/>you will get access to this data is very small. You can send a polite letter to these agencies, but it's <br/>very likely you get a polite no as an answer. <br/>
And then there are ethical problems. Even if you manage to get access to certain individuals <br/>
or files, you run the risk of being blamed to be one sided, or to be too much understanding. And that <br/>mainly holds for having interviews with terrorists or alleged terrorists. Some people might not like it, <br/>might think you're unethical. And the same holds for interviewing or working closely together with all <br/>kinds of police and intelligence organizations. There are other groups of people who think that's not, <br/>you shouldn't do that. partly and that's related to the fifth challenge is partly related to the reliability <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2_10></a>and validation problem. If you interview these people, if you get Access to, their sources, they might <br/>try to fool you. They might give you their version of the truth. they might try to influence you. And <br/>it's very difficult with all that secrecy involved to validate, to, to really try to check that the <br/>information you get is valuable or not. It's an enormous difficulty. This secrecy partly because it's <br/>related to ethical issues and reliability, and validation. But nothing is impossible. <br/>
One scholar that managed to overcome the secrecy problem is Jessica Sterm, a leading <br/>
scholar from Harvard that tried to answer the question, why religious militants kill? And she wrote a <br/>book, Terror in the Name of God. And she thought that the only way to answer the question why <br/>these people kill is to talk <br/>to them. So she talked to prisoners around the globe that in the past, at one point in time, wanted to <br/>be suicide terrorists or want to kill others in the name of God. And she got access to these prisons. In <br/>it, it's an enormous effort to, to gain the trust of these people, and also the trust of prison authorities, <br/>and in the end she interviewed quite a few of them. I think showing that it is possible to overcome <br/>the problem of secrecy, but again it caused her a lot of time. But it’s a great book. I think it's, it's one <br/>of the best efforts to try to understand the motivations of, of, of people to kill others in the name of <br/>God. <br/>
And here at the Center for Terrorism and Counter-terrorism of Leiden University, we've also <br/>
tried to talk to former terrorists and people who allegedly recruit for the Jihad in Syria. We think it's <br/>very important that you at least try to do so. And in some cases you can be successful. At the same <br/>time, we also have good relationships with law enforcement. The police intelligence community, <br/>again with the aim to try to better understand these actors. But the secrecy involved in the work of <br/>these actors remains an enormous obstacle. <br/>
In sum, there many difficulties and challenges, and I guess that secrecy is the most important <br/>
one. In the next video, we're going to see what scholars and experts have produced despite these <br/>challenges. <br/><b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2_11></a><b>2.5 Current state of the art <br/></b> <br/>In the previous session, we discussed the challenges and dilemmas when doing research on terrorism <br/>and counter-terrorism. And in an earlier video, we showed enormous increase in studies, centers, <br/>researchers, in the field of terrorism studies after 9 / 11. But what insights has this boom produced. <br/>And a most important question, do we know Much more about terrorism and counter terrorism <br/>before 9/11? <br/>
The answers to these questions by some of the leading scholars in the field show a relatively <br/>
critical attitude towards the products of the study of terrorism. But, in more recent statements, they <br/>seem to be rather positive about the kind of research that has been done in recent years. Well this is <br/>what they have to say Andrew Silke for instance who in 2004 wrote a very critical book about the <br/>results of terrorism studies <br/>in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 noticed in 2009. That the field of terrorism studies is beginning <br/>to stabilize from the biases in focus in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and a war on terror. And <br/>Magnus Ranstrorp, who is affiliated with the Swedish National Defense College, expressed the need <br/>for vigorous debates. Critical self-reflexivity and alternative analytical assumptions and approaches. <br/>
And the third quote, more recent one, is from Alex Schmid. Who, amongst all others, is a <br/>
fellow at the International Center for Counter-Terrorism, here in The Hague. While he's rather <br/>positive about latest developments, in 2011, he wrote, we're very happy with that. He said that <br/>terrorism studies has never been in a better shape than now. <br/>
Looking at these statements and having studied other works that look into the state of the <br/>
art in my field of study the following issues stand out. These are main characteristics, including both <br/>strong points and weaker points, and one of them is the focus on niches. a lot of terrorism <br/>researchers look into very specific types of terrorism or modus operandi. A good example of that is <br/>the interest in terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. A lot of books, articles, reports have been <br/>published about that. But it's, it's really not the type of terrorism that takes place most of the time. <br/>It's a very worrisome development. But some say too much attention has been focused on that. <br/>
Another example is lone wolf terrorism, or lone operator terrorism. Very interesting many <br/>
people, remember the horrible attack in, in Norway by Anders Breivik. We want to know, you know <br/>what, what motivates these people, why they do it, what can we do against it. But if we look at all <br/>incidents on terrorism, this is such a marginal phenomenon. It represents less than a percent of all <br/>attacks, maybe it's only one tenth of a percent. So we have to be careful. Do we devote a lot of <br/>attention to these very specific types of terrorism? However interesting they are, or do we Focus on <br/>the terrorism that most countries deal with every day. <br/>
A second characteristic of the state of the art of terrorism and counter terrorism studies is <br/>
the fact that it's based on the assumption that terrorism is a very big threat that terrorism <br/>constitutes of major attacks. And, if we look at the facts, we see that, in most countries, it's not a big <br/>physical threat. And at most, terrorist attacks are not of the scale of 9/11, Bombay or other major <br/>events. An issue of concern is the characteristic that the state of the art of terrorism studies is not <br/>focusing on comparative studies.  And that there's few theory testing. This is a problem. I'll come <br/>back to that later. <br/>
Now, we're going to do something about it. We're going to actually compare theory and <br/>
practice, something that needs to be done more according to many scholars in the field of terrorism <br/>studies. And next is the issue of the selection bias to western interests. What if I already given the <br/>example of Pakistan. Much attention to the threat posed by terrorism from Pakistan to the west and <br/>much less attention how terrorism affects Pakistan and Pakistani. And another characteristic is the <br/>policy oriented nature of research. Well, actually I think that's a positive Side of the state of the art of <br/>terrorism studies. There has been much research into questions that authorities have, governments <br/>have, how to deal with this threat. And much of the studies tried at least to give an answer to that. <br/>providing studies to questions that are relevant, especially in the field of counter terrorism. <br/>
And then the fundamental question. Do we know much more about terrorism and counter-<br/>
terrorism than let's say, 12 years ago? I think the answer is yes. Yes, we do know much more. But of <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2_12></a>course, there are under-researched issues, topics, that still need to be addressed. For a list of them, <br/>see the link to the journal Perspectives on Terrorism, which you find in the recommended readings. <br/>To sum up, we do know more about terrorism. And academia think tanks have produced interesting <br/>assumptions on causes, mechanisms and processes regarding terrorism and counter-terrorism. But <br/>we also notice that there has been a lack of theory testing and the testing of assumptions, and that's <br/>not a good thing. Why not? These assumptions are very often the basis of counter-terrorism policies, <br/>so if the assumptions are right, that's a good thing. But if the assumptions are wrong, maybe our <br/>counter-terrorism policies are wrong. So we need to test them. And that's what we're going to do. <br/>
We have selected five interesting assumptions. Either because they're challenged or the <br/>
opposite, they're very much trusted and the basis of policy-making. And these five assumptions are <br/>the following. First is terrorism is caused by poverty. Terrorists are crazy. Terrorism is increasingly <br/>lethal. And the last two are terrorism is predominantly anti-western, and terrorism is successful. Well <br/>is it? What about these assumptions? Are they true, partly true, false, or do we have to qualify them <br/>as myth? That's what we are going to discuss next week. <br/> <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3_1></a><b>3.1 Assumption: Terrorism is caused by poverty </b><br/>
Hi there, welcome back. Last week, we discussed the state of the art of terrorism and counter-<br/>terrorism studies. and looked into the difficulties, the challenges when doing research on this <br/>phenomena and we also showed a number of research products. Well, this week we are going to <br/>look at five of these products. Five interesting assumptions either because it challenged or the <br/>opposite that's very much true. And it's they called [INAUDIBLE] to basis of policy making of counter <br/>terrorism measures. Well, it's good to test them, to compare them with evidence and compare them <br/>with literature. <br/>
Also, because terrorism is a complex and ever changing phenomenal and that requires us to <br/>
update our theories and assumptions every now and then. Especially if they constitute the basis of <br/>policy making. The five assumptions that we're going to explore and analyze are the following. <br/>Terrorism is caused by poverty. That terrorists are crazy or insane. And the third assumption we're <br/>going to look at is terrorism is becoming increasingly lethal, it's getting more deadly. And then we'll <br/>look at the assumption that terrorism is predominantly anti-western. And finally we're going to look <br/>at whether or not terrorism is successful as stated by some. <br/>
The first assumption is about root causes of terrorism. It states that poverty causes terrorism. <br/>
It is an idea that is almost as old as the first attempts to understand terrorism. Where does it come <br/>from? The study of terrorism. But it should be stressed that the statement, this assumption is mostly <br/>put forward by politicians and public figures. Well, here are two examples. The first one is from the <br/>former US Secretary of State, General Colin Powell who in 2002 said the following. He said, I fully <br/>believe that the root cause of terrorism does come from situations where there is poverty, where <br/>there is ignorance, where people see no hope in their life. And the second example of somebody who <br/>states that poverty causes terrorism is the South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu. And in 2007 he <br/>said, you can never win a war against terror as long as there are conditions in the world that make <br/>people desperate. Poverty, diseases, ignorance. <br/>
Two excellent examples of very well-known public figures who have stated that poverty <br/>
causes terrorism. Are these eminent persons right or wrong? Is poverty a root cause of terrorism? <br/>First we are going to answer, why is it Actually assumed that there is a link between poverty and <br/>terrorism. Well the basic idea is that poverty leads to a lack of opportunities to improve the quality of <br/>somebody's life. I think Collin Powell referred to that. And that could result in anger towards people <br/>who are better off. Or into blaming the government for the Lack of these opportunities, and <br/>grievances is a keyword here. In combination with the idea that tears our rational acts. It is argued by <br/>some, that violence might be the last resort to put their grievances, their anger, their frustration on <br/>the police who attend them. <br/>
Well, all those point effect that there is terrorism in poor countries and that's some terrorists <br/>
indeed from the lower parts of society. And they subsequently assume a link Between the two, a co-<br/>relation between poverty and terrorism. We're going to look at that later on. And then finally it <br/>should be stressed that there are some terrorist organizations mainly extreme left wing organizations <br/>that claim to fight for the poor. Why does it matter? Why do we have to test this assumption? Well, <br/>obviously it has consequences for counter-terrorism measures. For instance, if you think that poverty <br/>is a root cause of terrorism, you might want to do a lot more about poverty. eradication, and of <br/>course that it's great for, for my humanitarian perspective. But you want to know it's really helpful to <br/>make the chance of a terrorist attack any smaller. But just like with many other different issues, <br/>counter terrorism policy makers are confronted with the  problem of allocating scans resources. <br/>Money, time, people. And if you spend it on poverty eradication, you can't spend it on something <br/>else. <br/>
So we want to know if poverty is really a root cause of terrorism or not. And we have to <br/>
decide whether it is important to eradicate poverty from a counter terrorism perspective. It's <br/>important in many other from many other perspectives, but is it also helpful in the fight against <br/>terrorism. I've shown a number of examples of Influential people who state that there's a link <br/>between poverty and terrorism, and I could have added many more. Well, interestingly, it's mainly <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3_2></a>politicians that make that claim. Politicians, world leaders even that are responsible for strategies <br/>and policies on important issues, such as terrorism. And the idea of a causal link between poverty <br/>and terrorism, doesn't sound far-fetched. But is it true, or is it a myth? <br/>
Well, let's compare the statement with empirical data and academic research. Let us first <br/>
have a look at some statistics, some examples. While studying the characteristics of individual <br/>terrorists, it seems strange to assume a direct link between poverty and terrorism. Most terrorists <br/>are not very poor, or much poorer than others. In fact, some terrorists are extremely rich. Think of <br/>Osama Bin Laden Perhaps the most well-known terrorist of our age, who came from a wealthy Saudi <br/>family. <br/>
And another example is the so-called Christmas Day bomber, Umar Farouk Abdumutallab, <br/>
who in 2009 tried to blow up a plane heading for Detroit. But he studied in London, and was of a <br/>well-to-do family from Nigeria. And there are many other examples of terrorists from upper or <br/>upper-middle class. Take, for instance, Anders Breivik, who killed almost 80 people in Norway. Or to <br/>take an example from the 1960s and 70s. from left-wing terrorism, Ulrike Meinhof, one of the key <br/>persons of the Rote Armee Fraktion. She also came from a well-to-do family, was highly educated, <br/>and had lots of opportunities in life. Studying the characteristics of Jihad terrorists in Europe. I found <br/>out that they were mainly children of migrants or migrants themselves. And they were of lower parts <br/>of society. But they were not poorer than other migrants or children of migrants. And the same holds <br/>for many terrorists in the less developed parts of this world. Many of them are perhaps not rich or <br/>not even middle class. but they are not poor than their fellow citizens. And this has been confirmed <br/>by quite a number of studies into the backgrounds of terrorists which we will discuss in a minute. I <br/>would like to go back to the map, I presented in the first week. The map showing the impact of <br/>terrorism in 2011. What do we see? <br/>
If we look at the map we see that Iraq, Afghanistan. Pakistan, India, Russia, and Nigeria are <br/>
most often confronted with terrorism. Are these the poorest countries in the world? Well let's take <br/>the statistics, of the world bank, that ranked 185 states of which they gathered data. Now we see <br/>that Iraq is number 111, on that list. And it's considered a higher middle income country. And <br/>Pakistan, India and Nigeria rank between 150 and 139, and they're considered lower income <br/>countries. And Russia, number 55 on the list, is actually one of the richest countries in the world, a <br/>high income country. Well, the only country that is in the bottom part of this list is Afghanistan, but <br/>there are 15 other countries that are less developed. And the ten countries with the lowest per <br/>capita. Gross Domestic Product do not experience high or even moderate levels of terrorism with the <br/>exception of the Democratic Republic of Congo. And you'll also see that Somalia is also Often faced <br/>with terrorism, but the World Bank didn't have data. <br/>
Well was the situation, perhaps different in the past? Let's take the example of Left-wing <br/>
terrorism in the 1960s and 1970s. It were countries like Germany, Italy and Japan that were most <br/>often hit by this type of terrorism. Well these countries, both then and today are among the richest <br/>in the world. So looking both at the individuals and at countries, there seems to be little support for <br/>the idea that poverty causes terrorism. But the assumption deserves a more in depth look.  <br/>
I would like to present to you the detailed study by James Piazza, who looked at the link <br/>
between poverty and terrorism. From different angles on a micro level. Well, in his study, he <br/>included many variables that could directly or indirectly be related to poverty, or associated with <br/>poverty. And, these factors or variables included Low levels per capita income. high levels of illiteracy, <br/>low life expectancy, and lack of employment opportunities. Well he looked closely at them, and he <br/>concluded that these poverty-related factors could not be linked to higher levels of terrorism. <br/>
Two scholars that did not use indicators of poverty on a macro level, but looked at individual <br/>
cases, individual lives, were Alan Krueger and Jitka Maleckova. And in there very often quoted study <br/>from 2003. they investigated the assumed link between poverty, education and terrorism. And their <br/>research found focused specifically on the militant wing of Hezbollah, the Shiite Islamic group and <br/>political party in Lebanon. Well they looked at these cases, they looked at the livers of these persons, <br/>the history of these persons, their biographies. And then found out that and I quote here, any <br/>connection between poverty, education and terrorism is indirect, complicated and probably quite <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3_3></a>weak. And they also concluded that terrorism is rather, and it shows you here, is caused by a <br/>response to political conditions and long-standing feelings of indignity and frustration that have very <br/>little to do with economics. We'll have a look at the reading list if you want to read the whole article <br/>of Krueger and Maleckova and the same holds for the other articles and reports I've mentioned. <br/>
So true or false, myth or fact? While studying the statistics and looking at the academic <br/>
literature There is very little support for the idea of a direct link between poverty and terrorism. And <br/>some argued that there might an indirect link, but it's very difficult to prove. And yes, of course there <br/>might be individual cases where people are motivated to turn to terrorism because of poverty. But <br/>there is no evidence to support the idea that poverty is a root cause of terrorism. <br/>
So, what have we learned? The idea of a closer relationship between poverty and terrorism, <br/>
is mainly put forward by politicians and public figures. But statistical data on individual terrorists and <br/>countries do not show a link between poverty and terrorism. And scholarly literature is quite clear <br/>about the lack of such a link. Therefore, this assumption we have to label a myth. In the next video <br/>we're going to explore the second assumption.  The assumption that terrorists are crazy. <br/><b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3_4></a><b>3.2 Assumption: Terrorists are crazy <br/> <br/></b>In the previous video, we debunked the myth that poverty is a root cause of terrorism. In this video, <br/>we will explore the assumption that terrorists are crazy, insane or psychotic. Well, the logic behind <br/>this assumption is simple. How is it possible, how can we imagine why people would kill innocent <br/>victims, why they would even, in some cases, kill themselves in the act. In many societies, this is <br/>regarded as a kind of behavior that is at least difficult to understand, in particular, the idea of suicide <br/>attacks and that raises many questions. How can somebody do a thing like that? And the answer very <br/>often is, these people must be insane. And there are examples of persons whose behavior both as <br/>terrorist or in court, feed the idea of crazy terrorist, but are they? Are they different from us? Do <br/>they suffer from any social, psychological disorder, or are they not that dissimilar from people who <br/>do not commit terrorist attacks? Or in other words, are they perhaps quite similar to you and me? <br/>
Here you see the faces of a number of alleged and convicted terrorists, and many people <br/>
have said that these persons were crazy. From left to right, first you see Ted Kaczynski, the so called <br/>unabomber, who amongst others send bomb letters to universities. And then Anders Breivik, the <br/>man who Killed so many people in Norway, a few years ago. And in the middle you see the face of <br/>Richard Reid, the so called shoe bomber, who try to blow up a plane, with a bomb that was hidden in <br/>his shoes. And then Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, who didn't do the attack <br/>himself, but he planned it. Can he be considered crazy or not? And then finally, Major Nidal Hasan, <br/>working for the US Armed Forces, a psychiatrist who killed 13 of his colleagues in Fort Hood, Texas. <br/>Were they crazy or not, are they really that much different from us? <br/>
Well, I guess and I hope that many of you find it very difficult to understand how somebody <br/>
can send a bomb letter knowing that people will be injured or killed or how somebody, like the case <br/>of Richard Reid, tries to blow up a plane or planned killing of thousands in New York, or kill his fellow <br/>colleagues. Often such violent acts evoke strong moral outrage that impedes us from a objective and <br/>proper analysis of the rational, and state of mind of terrorists. And because such acts are generally <br/>strongly condemned for good reasons, there is a tendency to regard these people as fundamentally <br/>different from us. Comparisons to mass murderers are easily drawn, and the same holds for school <br/>shooters. And we know that, in quite a few cases mass murderers and school shooters have been <br/>diagnosed with mental illnesses, and often times terrorists are put in that same category. A same <br/>category of persons who use indiscriminate and random violence, but there are differences. <br/>
The main difference between mass murderers and school shooters on the one hand and <br/>
terrorists on the other is that the former are not politically motivated and terrorists are, if we at least <br/>agree on the definition of terrorism is an instrument to achieve certain political goals. Well, in other <br/>words, there seems to be a fundamental difference in terms of rationality and if there is rationality in <br/>the act, and if this is regarded as part of a mechanism that is linked to some ideological idea, can you <br/>still call this act crazy, or the behavior of an insane person? I would like to stress that understanding <br/>the rationale behind these acts, doesn't mean you cannot condemn it at the same time. So <br/>understanding doesn't mean condoning and you might also want to still consider this kind of <br/>rationality as an example of crazy thinking. I mean terms like crazy and sane are subjective concepts, <br/>so are they crazy or not? It's a difficult question, difficult to define and difficult to answer, why is it, <br/>nonetheless, to answer these questions?  <br/>
If many terrorists indeed suffer from mental illnesses it has consequences for <br/>
counterterrorism, it might require more cooperation with actors in mental healthcare. And, at the <br/>same time, it might lead to the conclusion that there is little we can do, as in every society there are <br/>people with all kinds of illnesses, mental illnesses, disorders and we cannot jail everybody just <br/>because they are not like you and I. And another consequence of this assumption is there is no use in <br/>investigating the motivations, the rationale of terrorists groups or terrorist individuals. I mean, there <br/>is no motivation or rationale, they're simply crazy. <br/>
Well, how have scholars and experts dealt with these questions? In the second week we've <br/>
discussed the approaches in the study of terrorism, among them the rational or instrumental <br/>approach. Well, this approach strongly rejects the idea that terrorists are crazy. Terrorism is a <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3_5></a>rational behaviour making terrorists rational actors that kill to achieve certain political goals. So, they <br/>don't kill because they're crazy, they kill to achieve something and also within this second approach <br/>in terrorism studies, the social-psychological approach, there is consensus that terrorists are not <br/>crazy. Jerrold Post for instance, one of the Leading scholars in the field of the psychology of terrorists <br/>and author of the book The Mind of the Terrorist, is very clear on the question whether or not <br/>terrorists are very different from us. He stated it is not going too far to Assert that terrorists are <br/>psychologically normal, that is, not clinically psychotic. And he also said, they are not depressed, And <br/>not severely emotionally disturbed, nor are they crazed fanatics. In fact, terrorist groups and <br/>organizations regularly weed out emotionally unstable individuals. They represent, after all, a <br/>security risk. <br/>
So even the organizations, they are very keen not to allow crazy people to be part of their <br/>
organization, according to Jarrold Post. And then Louise Richardson, she noted at a Level of the <br/>individual psychologies to have long argued that there is no particular terrorist personality and that a <br/>notion of terrorists as crazed fanatics is not consistent with the plentiful empirical evidence available. <br/>And allow me to also mention the Israeli scholar, Ehud Sprinzak, who would regard terrorists as <br/>fanatics. Yes they are fanatic, but he would also call them rational fanatics, even to describe suicide <br/>bombers. This is not to say that there are no terrorists that are clinically, psychotic to use the term of <br/>Gerald Post. And there are some scholars, that have observed, mental disturbances, disorders among <br/>terrorists that are more frequent among them, then among the general population. And I would also <br/>like to stress that the lack of empirical evidence is partly related to the fact that it is very difficult to <br/>diagnose terrorists. Very few scholars have had the opportunity to interview and monitor terrorists <br/>the way psychiatrists normally can. Nonetheless, there's very little empirical Evidence that suggests <br/>that terrorists are crazy, and many scholars agree on the rationality of their behavior, but more <br/>research is needed. That is why I would not label this assumption a myth,I would label it false. <br/>
In sum, we have to explore the idea that terrorists are creating, and although many people <br/>
find it difficult to understand the behavior of terrorists in particular that of suicide terrorists, <br/>academic research has shown that terrorists are, clinically speaking, normal. This means the <br/>assumption that terrorists are crazy is false. In the next video, we will explore the idea that terrorism <br/>is increasingly becoming lethal. <br/><b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3_6></a><b>3.3 Assumption: Terrorism is increasingly lethal <br/> <br/></b>In the last video, we explored the assumption that terrorists are mentally ill or psychotic. And this <br/>video, we'll look into the assumption that terrorism has become more lethal, more deadly, in the <br/>past decades. This assumption can be interpreted in two ways. <br/>
First, you can look at the number of fatalities, the total number of people being killed in <br/>
terrorist attacks. And you can also see it from a different angle by looking at individual terrorist <br/>attacks. Have they become more deadly? Are there today more victims per attack than in the past? It <br/>should be noted that these two sides are independent of each other, the origin of this claim or <br/>assumption can be linked to the idea that terrorism has been defining feature of our era, and that we <br/>live in a post 9/11 world. And it also rooted in the idea that the size and shape of terrorism is <br/>different, it's different now than in the past. After 9/11, it has become a very big threat, more so than <br/>in the past. Here are some examples of quotes by politicians, government agencies and scholars that <br/>hint at a new type of terrorism, one that is deadlier than in the past. <br/>
Well, the first quote is by Dick Cheney, who was then the vice president of the United States. <br/>
And in 2004, he said, the biggest threat we face now as a nation is the possibility of terrorists ending <br/>up, in the middle of one of our cities with deadlier weapons than have ever before been used against <br/>us. Biological agents, or a nuclear weapon, or a chemical weapon of some kind to be able to threaten <br/>the life of hundreds of thousands of Americans. On the other side of the globe, you have the <br/>Australians and the Australian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in that same year stated something similar. <br/>It stated, advances in weapons technology Are making them, the terrorists, more lethal than ever <br/>before, the range of weapons at the terrorists disposal is wide and increasing. And finally, a quote <br/>from a scholar, Peter Neumann, a German scholar working in London at King's College who in 2009 <br/>said, In the era of the new terrorism, the two considerations, violence and symbolic value seem to <br/>have merged, with mass casualty attacks against civilian populations being routine and intentional. <br/>Are these ideas and statements based on facts and proper analysis? <br/>
Well, unfortunately the attacks on 9/11 and the ones in Bombay, Besilam, Baghdad and Bali, <br/>
they were facts and these and other deadly attacks cost the lives of many people. So, yes they are <br/>very lethal and they made headlines worldwide, sometimes for days. Well if you add then the many <br/>threats posed by terrorists groups to attack, including threatening to do so with weapons to be used <br/>in mass causality attacks. And also add the interest of certain groups in unconventional weapons and <br/>even weapons of mass destruction, then the idea of increasing legality becomes even stronger. And <br/>we did see in the street of Iraq, Pakistan, people that are willing and able to make more sophisticated <br/>explosives and to use them in suicide attacks. In other words, a worrisome combination of new <br/>techniques and tactics and maybe I should add different ethics and different codes, that make it <br/>possible for terrorists to kill more people and to kill more people at the same time. In a previous <br/>video I quoted Byron Jenkins, who in 1975 stated that terrorist want a lot of people watching, but not <br/>a lot of people dead, and I also said that in 2006, he rephrased that statement. <br/>
In 2006 he said, the most striking development is that terrorism has become bloodier in <br/>
terms of what acts are committed and how many victims are involved. And in this publication in 1975, <br/>he described a number of constraints that the terrorist were facing at that time. these constraint <br/>included a sense of morality, a self-image, operational codes and practical concerns. Well, in 2006, he <br/>noted, these constraints gave way to large scale, indiscriminate violence and he rephrased his <br/>famous quote from 1975. And the new quote is as follows, he says, many of today's terrorists want a <br/>lot of people watching and a lot of people dead. Is Bryan Jenkins right in assuming terrorist want a lot <br/>of people dead? And have terrorists managed to achieve that? Has terrorism become more deadly <br/>than in the past decades? Why should we investigate this assumption? Well, if terrorism is becoming <br/>more lethal, maybe we should devote more means to fight this very serious physical threat. But what <br/>if it's not? Well, we think it is. Maybe we have spent too much money on countering it. Money, <br/>scarce resources we could have used for other important issues, such as the eradication of poverty, <br/>making the world a better place. But if terrorism is indeed more deadly, Maybe we should look for <br/>tougher measures to fight it. But if it's not, maybe we should have a closer look at the proportionality <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3_7></a>of the measures we have taken in the past. Maybe it has become less deadly and maybe we have <br/>overreacted after 9/11, 9/11 and other such attacks that gave us the impression, rightly or wrongly <br/>that terrorism attack has become more deadly. <br/>
Myth or fact, let us compare the assumption with empirical evidence. What are the number <br/>
of people killed in terrorist attacks, and how does that develop over time? To answer that question, <br/>we use the background report, 9/11 ten years later, of the national consortium for the study of <br/>terrorism and responses to terrorism, also known as start, which is based at Maryland University. <br/>Here is a graph with the number of fatalities worldwide because of terrorism in the period 1991, <br/>2011. So the period before and after the attacks on the United States. What do you see? Well you <br/>see that the numbers are pretty high in the early 1990s with 8 to 10,000 people being killed. Then it <br/>goes down 1995, goes up again to a pretty high number in 1997 and it reaches a relatively low <br/>number just before 9/11, still greater number of people killed because of terrorism. in 2000-3000 too <br/>many, but a relatively low level. And then 9/11 that itself cost three thousand lives shows an increase <br/>but also very quickly it goes back to pre 9/11 levels, and then from 2003 on you see a gradual <br/>increase which leads to a peak in 2007, 2008 of more than 12,000 or about 12,000 fatalities in those <br/>years. But since then the line again is going downward, so what do we make out of this? What do you <br/>think yourself, how would you describe this trend? I think it can best be described as a, a trend with <br/>ups and downs, but, you can't say that it's in general going up or down. And I think there are no <br/>indications for the future, it could go up again, it could go down even further. I think what you can <br/>say is that there is No general trend and it's definitely not one, that is only going upwards. But of <br/>course there are differences and this holds for terrorism in general, for you, for instance the trend is <br/>in downward one. But for South-Asia, unfortunately, the trend is up. But what about the lethality in <br/>terms of the number of people killed or injured per attack? Is there a clear picture regarding this part <br/>of the assumption? <br/>
Well again I would like to use the work of James Piazza who also was helpful in exploring <br/>
whether or not poverty leads to terrorism, and in this study, an article of his from 2009, he explores <br/>data on victims per international terrorist attack. So, he doesn't look at all types of attacks, but he <br/>talks about international terrorist attacks, and he used the data of the terrorism knowledge base that <br/>was later incorporated in the global terrorism data base. Well, he shows that the number of victims <br/>per international terrorist attack has increased. his data showed that in a period of 1968, 1979, they <br/>were on average a little over two victims per attack and that includes both injured and killed, and <br/>that number has gone up. In than 1980's it was almost 4, and in the 1990's it increased to over 10 <br/>victims per attack, and in the first five years of the new millennium, so between 2000 and 2005, it <br/>increase even further to almost 11 victims. Well this provides us, I guess, with a clear picture <br/>regarding locality when looking at the number of causalities per attack. Unfortunately it has gone up <br/>in recent Decades and now the conclusion, myth or fact, true or false, is terrorism becoming more <br/>deadly? We already falsified the part of the assumption that says that terrorism kills more and more <br/>people each year, fortunately, that is not the case. But the part of the assumption that says That <br/>there are more victims per attack, more people killed and injured in each incident, well, that has <br/>gone up in recent years. Combining the two, I think we should conclude that the assumption that <br/>terrorism is increasingly lethal is partly true. <br/>
To sum up, we discussed the perception, that terrorism has become increasingly lethal, <br/>
especially after 9/11. This is only partly true, the number of fatalities each year has gone up and <br/>down in the past decades, only the number of victims per attack has increased significantly. In the <br/>next video, we're going to look into the assumption that terrorism is predominately anti-western. <br/> <br/>
 <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3_8></a><b>3.4 Assumption: Terrorism is predominantly anti-western <br/></b> <br/>In the previous video, we looked into the idea that terrorism is becoming increasingly deadly. And in <br/>this video, we're going to explore the assumption that terrorism is predominantly anti-Western. Well, <br/>this assumption can be broken down into two parts. <br/>
First, we're going to focus are the targets. Are the targets of terrorism mainly westerners, or <br/>
are they not? And then we look at rhetoric’s. Is the language or the slogans. Is the discourse of <br/>terrorists mainly anti-western? Where does the assumption come from? What's the origin of the <br/>claim? Well, President of the United States George W Bush hinted at it in a speech which he <br/>delivered about 10 days after the attacks on his country in 2001. And in this speech or his address to <br/>the nation he said the following. Americans are asking&#34; Why do they hate us?&#34; They hate what they <br/>see right here in this chamber: a democratically elected government. Their leaders are self-appointed. <br/>They hate our freedoms, our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and <br/>assemble, and disagree with each other. Thus hinting at an anti-western idea, or an anti-western <br/>agenda. <br/>
And there are many interviews with Osama Bin Laden the then leader of Al-Qaida that are <br/>
proof of an anti-western agenda. In an interview with Al Jazeera in 2002 for instance, he stated that <br/>the priority in this war at this stage must be against the infidels. The Americans and the Jews who <br/>have not stopped their injustice. And also scholars and experts have pointed at anti-western talk, and <br/>anti-western terrorist attacks. <br/>
Well, one of them is Walid Fharis, who wrote several books about what he calls Jihadism or <br/>
jihadists. And the author describes and analyzes through multiple examples of terrorist groups and <br/>individuals how jihad has waged a war against the west. An ideological war against western <br/>civilization and democracy. <br/>
Some have argued that this anti-western jihadist terrorism, also known as Islamist terrorism, <br/>
is a new type of terrorism. Martha Crenshaw, for instance, in a book published in 2000 stated the <br/>following. She said, several recent works focus on a New terrorism that is motivated by religious <br/>belief, and is more fanatical, deadly and pervasive than the older and more instrumental forms of <br/>terrorism the world has grown accustomed to. And she also shows that this new terrorism is <br/>described as anti-western terrorism originating in the middle east, that is linked to radical or <br/>fundamentalist Islam. And in the same book, which was published before 911, Martha Crenshaw also <br/>noted that. Alarm over the emergence of radical Islam was heightened by a combination of factors. <br/>The resort to suicide bombing in Lebanon and Israel. A general willingness to inflict mass civilian <br/>casualties, and anti-American and anti-Western targeting patterns. <br/>
Why is it important to test this assumption? If we continue to believe and continue to say the <br/>
terrorism is predominantly anti-Western, of course we will strengthen this perception. But what if it <br/>not true. What if terrorism It's not mainly aimed against the west? Then, spreading the idea of anti-<br/>western Terrorism is not very helpful. In fact, in that case, we will help those who would like to <br/>threaten the west and we will make some anti-western groups a lot bigger than they are. <br/>
Moreover, we might contribute to the notion of a clash of civilization, as put forward by <br/>
Samuel Huntington. Or we might strengthen this idea of a clash or struggle between Christianity and <br/>Islam. Again, this is not a good idea when the Facts do not support such a clash or such a struggle. <br/>Those kind of frames might for instance influence the way we look at each other. Well, the way we <br/>look at individuals from different cultural backgrounds. It can lead to generalization and stereotyping. <br/>And for instance in the West, it could lead to that some people might see their Muslim neighbor as a <br/>potential anti-Western person, as a potential enemy. And that is why we have to compare this <br/>assumption with facts. <br/>
Is terrorism predominantly aimed against Westerners or not? Or is it only rhetoric, only <br/>
empty threats? Regarding the threats, it should be mentioned that there have been many calls for <br/>terrorist action against the West. I already mentioned Al-Qaida, which is of course one of the most <br/>important ones, but there are many other groups as well. But what about the facts on the ground? <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3_9></a>Do these groups mainly target Westerners, do they mainly target the West? Well, there are many <br/>different ways to answer that question. <br/>
Let us first look at a geographical approach. Here's a map of terrorist incident or the terrorist, <br/>
the impact of terrorism in 2011. Well, we see that the regions that suffered the most from the <br/>terrorism are not in the west. The West is, is confronted with very low levels of terrorism. Look at <br/>North America, South America, Western Europe, Australia, and compare that with the figures and <br/>the colors in the middle East. Compare it with Iraq, or South Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and in <br/>Africa. It's also mainly Muslim countries that are faced with terrorism. North Africa, Nigeria, mainly <br/>the northern part. And also Russia has a lot of terrorism, but it's also mainly the southern part, the <br/>Caucuses region, the Muslim part of that country. <br/>
So not the West, actually, the Muslim world is most often confronted with terrorism. And <br/>
who are being killed in these attacks? In all of the countries mentioned, the overwhelming majority <br/>of the victims are Muslim. And there are many sources that conform this. And the data are striking. <br/>Well, here you have the figures of the United States National Counter Terrorism Center. And in their <br/>report on terrorism 2011,they say that Muslims suffered between 82 and 90%, 97% of terrorism <br/>related fatalities. It appeared 2005, 2010, worldwide. <br/>
And other sources show that even in Iraq. In the years after 2003, meaning, in the years after <br/>
the US led the invasion. Where there was an enormous presence of westerns troops, the majority of <br/>the attacks by al-Qaeda affiliates was against fellow Muslims, not against Western troops. So the <br/>rhetoric may be predominantly anti-Western, but the victims are Muslim not Westerners. <br/>
And what about the situation in the West? The few attacks in the west, are they perhaps <br/>
predominantly anti-western? According to Europol's terrorism situation and trend report, 2013, <br/>there was 17 deadly victims in the European Union in 2012. And less than half of them were the <br/>result of terrorist acts by religiously inspired groups, that's the political correct term for Islamist or <br/>Jihadist terrorism. <br/>
They also say that there were a total 219 attacks, and they were mainly carried out in France <br/>
and Spain. But they are carried out by terrorists Groups that are called separatists or F mo-nationalist <br/>group. And a religiously inspired to has carried Out only 6 attacks within the European Union in 2012. <br/>And one of them was the attack by Mohammed Mira of a veteran from the fight in Afghanistan, who <br/>in an around his hometown Toulouse in France killed 7 people. Thus, even in Europe, most of the <br/>attacks cannot be labeled anti-western. What about North America? What about United States? <br/>According to the statistics of the United States State Department for the year 2012, there were no <br/>casualties because of anti-Western terrorism on US soil. <br/>
So the assumption that terrorism is predominantly anti-Western, is it true, partly true, false, <br/>
or should we call it a myth? Well, I guess we see a mixed picture. The rhetoric of Al Qaeda and other <br/>islamist or jihadist group is definitely anti-western. And these religiously inspired groups seem to <br/>dominate the current wave of terrorism. They're responsible for high number of attacks and many <br/>victims. <br/>
However, when we look at these victims or Look at the targets, we see that includes <br/>
relatively few westerners. The main group of victims of these attacks are other Muslim countries and <br/>other Muslims. And in the West the majority of the attacks are linked to separatist groups, right wing <br/>groups, left wing groups, but not anti-Western groups. Therefore, I guess, we can label this <br/>assumption as partly true or even false, depending whether you regard rhetoric as important as <br/>people killed in terrorism.  Well, having said that, I think it’s more appropriate to label this <br/>assumption as falsified. <br/>
To sum up, the rhetoric of much of today's terrorism is anti-Western, but its victims are not. <br/>
They're not westerners, they're Muslims. Combining these two observations, we label The <br/>assumption that terrorism is predominantly anti-western false. In the next video, we will investigate <br/>the idea that terrorism is successful. <br/> <br/>
 <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3_10></a><b>3.5 Assumption: Terrorism is successful <br/></b> <br/>In a previous video, we discussed the assumption that terrorism is predominantly anti-western, <br/>arriving at the conclusion that it's partly true, or even false. In this video, we will investigate the idea <br/>that terrorism is successful. Who's saying the terrorists are successful? I guess I partly contributed to <br/>that, by repeatedly stating that terrorism is making headlines, and it's high on political agendas. <br/>That's true. And isn't that what terrorists want? Is that a success? Is it enough to be talked about in <br/>political forum? Well, I guess that's not enough. And if you take the definitions of terrorism, it very <br/>often contains the words, political goals. And that's helpful when determining levels of success for <br/>terrorism. And if you agree that terrorism is an instrument to achieve certain political goals by means <br/>of violence and intimidation, the criteria should be twofold. <br/>
First, does terrorism create attention and cause fear? And then the second question, do <br/>
terrorists achieve their political goals? These are relatively simple criteria to Measure the success and <br/>compared it with empirical evidence. Think of public opinion polls, or discourse analysis, and with <br/>academic literature. And of course, there are many different ways to, and many different criteria, to <br/>measure the direct or indirect success of terrorism. Here are a few examples. Terrorism might be <br/>called successful if They reach a high number of casualties. Or when they are perceived as powerful <br/>actors, with whom a government or any other actor has to deal with, or negotiate with. Or when the <br/>terrorists avoid capture or death, and when the organization itself is able to survive, and the <br/>continuity of the organization. If they last for decades is that is, maybe not also an example of <br/>success. <br/>
Well, what most academics have done, they have simply looked at the stated political aims of <br/>
these organizations, and have just looked at whether or not they achieve these particular goals. Well, <br/>I think that's too narrow, and I think one also has to look at the level of fear and media coverage. <br/>Perhaps, these are not goals in itself, but they are important intermediate goals. Without that <br/>attention, without that levels of fear, the political goals will surely not come. And, I would also like to <br/>add that being feared, and being hurt, might be an important goal to some terrorists organizations <br/>on its own. Well, we'll look at that later. Let us first explore the level of success In terms of the <br/>achieved political goals of terrorist organizations. <br/>
Why do most scholars primarily focus on political goals, when trying to determine whether or <br/>
not terrorism is successful? What can be linked to the very important rational, or instrumental <br/>approach, in studying terrorism. According to that approach, terrorism is an instrument to achieve <br/>certain goals. Employed by rational individuals, who are making some sort of cost-benefit analysis, to <br/>determine their tactics and strategy. And, with this line of thought, it can be assumed that terrorists, <br/>somehow, think that there is at least a small chance to achieve some of their political goals. Well, of <br/>course, there are other approaches to look at the success of terrorism and their other authors, who <br/>have a different take on this. This holds, for instance, for Max Abrahms, Who has repeatedly <br/>challenged this rational or instrumental approach. In his publication, Why terrorism does not work, <br/>he analyzed 28 terrorist organizations that are on the designated... this list of designated terrorist <br/>organizations of the United States Department of State. While he analyzed these groups, and his <br/>analysis yielded two distinct conclusions. First, the groups accomplished their policy objectives only <br/>7% of the time. Only 7% of the time. Second, the level of success depends on tactical choices, in <br/>particular target selection. And, he shows that groups whose attacks on civilian targets are <br/>outnumbered. The attacks on military targets, systematically, fail to achieve their policy objectives. <br/>
These findings suggest that terrorists groups rarely achieve their policy objectives, and that <br/>
the poor success rate is inherent to the tactic of terrorism itself. You fail if you attack civilians. That's <br/>really the bottom line. And according to Abrahms, the outcome of this study challenges the dominant <br/>scholarly opinion, that terrorism is strategically rational behavior. How can it be, if terrorism, <br/>obviously, provides very, very limited political return for the efforts of the terrorists? Other authors <br/>have reached similar Conclusions about a lack of success for terrorists. Raising of course the question, <br/>why do they continue their struggle, if it doesn't lead to achieving political goals? <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3_11></a>Paul Wilkinson, for instance, noted that some terrorists appear to believe that terrorism will <br/>
always work for them, in the end, by intimidating their opponents into submitting to terrorists <br/>demands. But he also observes, that terrorists only Very rarely succeeded in achieving some of their <br/>strategic goals. And he mentioned that, there are only few exceptions in recent history, which <br/>occurred in the period of anti-colonial struggles against the British and the French. And he, gives the <br/>example of the Front de la Liberation Nationale in Algeria, which he considers a success. But I'm not <br/>sure if you want to label that terrorism. And in the period after that, in the post-colonial period, <br/>there's not a single case of a success for terrorism, in terms of seizing control in any country. And <br/>Wilkinson says that, the use of terrorism as a weapon, by insurgents, has backfired and alienated the <br/>local population. <br/>
Another important author that has looked Into the success of terrorism is Brian Jenkins. In an <br/>
article, in 2006, he expresses worries over increased professionalism of terrorists, and the increase in, <br/>casualties caused by terrorism. But he's skeptical about their success. He observes that terrorists <br/>have escalated their violence, developed new methods of financing their operations, explored new <br/>communication strategies, and created new organizational models. But he also notes, they have yet <br/>to achieve their own stated long range objectives, and he calls that the paradox of terrorism. <br/>Terrorist often succeed tactically, and thereby, gain attention, cause alarm, and attract recruits. But <br/>their struggle has brought them no success measured against their own stated goals. In that sense, <br/>terrorism has failed, but the phenomenon of terrorism continues, according to Jenkins. <br/>
How do these findings relate to the case of Al Qaeda? Is Al Qaeda successful? Or is it likely to <br/>
succeed in achieving its stated goals in the future? Well, one of the problems is that, it's difficult to <br/>define Al Qaeda. Are we talking about core Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, Pakistan, or Al Qaeda and its <br/>closest affiliates in Iraq, the Magra, the Arab peninsula. Or are we also talking about the network of <br/>Al Qaeda, including a wide range of organizations that somehow are ideologically linked To the <br/>organization. And what about its political goals? Well, I guess we look at core Al Qaeda and its closest <br/>affiliates. What were, or are their political goals? Well, the problem is that they are rather vague and <br/>seem to change all the time. They include, or have included, the establishment of a Pan-Islamic <br/>Caliphate, the overthrow of known Islamic regimes, and the expulsion of all foreigners from Muslim <br/>countries. And of course, the killing of Jews, Americans, and other so called infidels. <br/>
Well, how successful has Al Qaeda been? Well, looking at these scores, what do you think? I <br/>
think they've failed miserably, at the cost of many lives of innocents from Washington to New York, <br/>and from Baghdad to Riyadh, and Amon. So at a very, very high price. Nonetheless, Al Qaeda has <br/>managed to drag the United States and its allies, into a costly war in Afghanistan, and military <br/>operations in other parts of the world. And many authorities in many countries still have to invest in <br/>countering the threat posed by Al Qaeda, its affiliates, and it's sympathizers. Despite the fact that <br/>many of its leaders have been captured or killed, Al Qaeda is still making headlines. And this raises <br/>the question, whether or not, one should only measure the success of terrorist groups, like Al Qaeda, <br/>by solely looking at the extent to which they have reached their stated political goals. What about <br/>high levels of fear, or the enormous investments they force to counterterrorism, or the fact that <br/>threat posed by terrorism is still high on the political agenda. Should that not also be considered a <br/>sign of success? And if so, how successful have terrorism and terrorist organizations been in recent <br/>years? <br/>
If we look at the success of terrorism in terms of making headlines, it's clear that terrorists <br/>
are very good at that. Or maybe I should rephrase that and say That terrorists, and the media, are <br/>very good at that. After all, it's not the terrorists that write the headlines, it's the journalists that do <br/>so, because there is demand for it. Because you and I expect them to do that. Well, there are quite a <br/>number of studies that have looked into the use of the word terrorism in the media, in various media <br/>reports. And it shows that terrorism has, indeed, been making headlines, almost on a daily basis, in <br/>many parts of the world. And, there is this study, by Iyengar and Kinder in 1987, that shows that <br/>between 1981 and 1986. More news stories were broadcast by the three TV networks in the United <br/>States ABC, CBS, and NBC on terrorism, than on poverty, unemployment, racial inequality, and crime <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3_12></a>together. This is a study from a couple years before 9/11, actually quite a number of years before <br/>9/11. <br/>
So in the mid-1980s, even then, terrorism was making headlines, more often than poverty, <br/>
unemployment, racial inequality, and crime all together. And there are many other studies that have <br/>looked into media coverage, in general, about terrorism, and of course, the media coverage about <br/>after 9/11. While in the immediate aftermath of this, the unprecedented attacks on the United States <br/>in 2001, the general conclusion is that the reporting of it was also unprecedented. It went on for days, <br/>and really all parts Of the world were confronted with the images, the horrible images. Well, you've <br/>probably seen them. <br/>
But also, the attack on the Boston marathon, managed to make headlines worldwide, even <br/>
though the attack was a relatively minor one. Three fatalities, or course, three too many, and there <br/>too many injured as well. But, it is a minor attack compared to terrorist incidents in Iraq, Colombia, <br/>India, or other places. Nonetheless, even on the other side of the planet, in Fiji, it made headlines. <br/>And the Fiji Times reported, about it and produced a lengthy article with pictures. And it read as <br/>follows: Fijians living in Boston, United States, remained indoors as authorities began investigations <br/>into two bomb blasts. Targeting thousands of people participating in the Boston Marathon, so, <br/>unfortunately, terrorist managed to make headlines terrorism, in terms of spreading dread and fear, <br/>we have to look at public opinion polls of recent years. <br/>
Take for instance the famous Gallop polls. Several times each year they have asked <br/>
Americans how worried they are, that they or a family member could become a victim of terrorism. <br/>And about a quarter of the Americans held this concern in April 2000, which was a decrease, <br/>compared to a figure of 39% in the mid 1990's, in 1996. And it then registered highs of 58 and 59%, in <br/>the immediate aftermath of 9/11, in its first weeks, after these events, but has then since varied <br/>between 28 and 48%. In early 2013, after the Boston Marathon Bombing, this number was 40%, <br/>which is still, more or less, the same as the level of 1996. While one could argue that the Americans <br/>are, more or less, back to pre 9/11 levels of worries over terrorism, still a pretty high number, I <br/>should say. <br/>
Well, the same holds for Europe. The Eurobarometer, which is a public opinion poll by the <br/>
European Union, shows that concern over terrorism, also, had its ups and downs in the past decade. <br/>And that it's back at pre 9/11 levels, which are significantly lower than in the United States. <br/>Nonetheless, even today, in many western countries, terrorism is among the top ten worries of its <br/>populations. Unfortunately, there are few public Opinion polls outside the western world that <br/>specifically focus on terrorism, and that ask questions about terrorism on a regular basis. So, what to <br/>make of all these ideas and facts about the level of success of terrorism. <br/>
Well, it depends very much on your definition of success. Very few terrorist organizations <br/>
achieved their stated political goals, but they do manage to attract a lot of media attention. The <br/>levels of fears are caused by their actions, however, do not last forever. They gradually fade out after <br/>a few years. So, the terrorists get the attention they seek, but otherwise, they are not very successful. <br/>I think, therefore, that we should label this assumption as partly true.  In this video, we try to <br/>measure the success of terrorism. <br/>
We learned that terrorist organizations are not very successful in achieving their political <br/>
goals. But they do manage to attract attention, and some terrorists, attacks can lead to high levels of <br/>fear. Therefore, we label the assumption that terrorism is successful as only partly  true. Next week <br/>we will investigate five assumptions on counter terrorism, and compare them with empirical <br/>evidence and academic literature. I hope to see you back Next week. <br/> <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_1></a><b>4.1 Assumption: One can recognize a terrorist <br/></b> <br/>Hi there. Last week we discussed five assumptions on terrorism, and we compared them with <br/>empirical evidence and scholarly literature. This week we will look into five assumptions on counter-<br/>terrorism. Five assumptions we consider interesting, again, either because they're challenged or the <br/>opposite, they're considered very much true and constitute the basis of much policy making. Well, I <br/>already mentioned several times That terrorism is a constantly changing phenomenon, which means <br/>you have to update, revise, evaluate not only your policies, but also theories and assumptions. <br/>
Well, we're going to look into five of them, five assumptions on counter-terrorism. And they <br/>
are the following. First we will investigate the idea that one can recognize a terrorist. Then, <br/>deradicalisation of terrorists, is it possible or not? And then the third assumption is decapitation of <br/>terrorist groups works. And then terrorism cannot be defeated, a statement heard quite often. And <br/>then finally, terrorism can best be Managed by a so-called holistic or wide approach. <br/>
One of the key problems when researching terrorism is the secretive nature of terrorists and <br/>
terrorism, they work in the dark, underground, it's very difficult to study them. Well, this challenge is <br/>also a challenge to policymakers. They would like to know who they're dealing with, and they would <br/>like to discover terrorists before they strike. And a phrase that is connected to that need and <br/>challenge is the following, looking for the needle in the haystack. Well that sounds like a mission <br/>impossible, you can't find a needle in a haystack. But fortunately, there have been quite a Few cases <br/>of terrorists that have been caught before they managed to strike and some have been caught <br/>afterwards based on certain clues or signs. So apparently it's not impossible to find them. And <br/>perhaps they are recognizable. Perhaps it is possible to make a distinction between terrorists on the <br/>one hand and non-terrorists on the other, and to find terrorists out of a larger population of non-<br/>terrorists. <br/>
Well the process or tool to do so is called profiling. How does it work? Profiling goes under <br/>
different names, Including its original, criminal or offender profiling. And there are different types of <br/>profiling. The main distinction is that between a focus on the individual characteristics of a person, <br/>versus a focus on their behavior. So personality profiling versus behavioral profiling. And the most <br/>prevalent method of attempting to achieve a distinction between an offender, either a criminal or a <br/>terrorist, and a non-offender is to establish a set of psychological, socio-economic, physical, <br/>behavioral, and or ethnic attributes based on prior experiences. Well, in other words, indicators that <br/>tell us what a terrorist might look like, what are its behavioral or personality traits, and in what <br/>circumstances do they live and work, all together making up the terrorist profile. And oftentimes, this <br/>is followed by data mining or data searching, using various sources for what is called secondary <br/>security screening of the group of individuals with the largest number of indicators. <br/>
So it's two steps.  First, you look at the population as a whole, then you have a group that <br/>
have quite a number of indicators, and then you're, you are going to do some data mining, data <br/>searching, trying to and hopefully getting out of it, a number of people that might be terrorists or, <br/>ideally, that are the terrorists. Well, if it works. In an ideal situation, it might offer the counter-<br/>terrorism agencies a perfect tool to discover terrorists without much prior information about this <br/>individual or group, purely based on past experiences, past experience with other groups or <br/>individuals. Obviously there's a demand for a tool that could really do this. Terrorist attacks cost a lot <br/>of casualties and property damage, and counter-terrorism measures have an impact on the lives of <br/>many and also cost a lot. <br/>
Well here's a, a statement that is a good example of the demand for a tool, a mechanism to <br/>
make a distinction between terrorists and non-terrorists. And it's a statement from a, a newspaper in <br/>Germany that was published in December 2010, and it said airports demand racial profiling to fight <br/>terror. And it reads, the incoming head of Germany's main airport lobby group is Demanding the <br/>nation's transit authorities use racial profiling to weed out terrorists at security checks. Well, the idea <br/>is that it does not only make travelling safer but it also reduce costs. If you use your resources to try <br/>to scan and assess everyone you're wasting a lot of money a lot of time as well that could also be <br/>used on other precautionary measures. So, any tool that could help us to speed up that process or <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_2></a>limit the time that we're waiting at airports would, of course, be very helpful. Well on top of that, <br/>most of these measures at airports that take a lot of time that you and I might find annoying, also <br/>gives us the idea that terrorism is a big threat. And that's actually what terrorists want, they want us <br/>to believe that they pose a big threat. <br/>
So there's a lot to say for any tool that could help us to reduce time, reduce cost, and also <br/>
make us make it less feasible that we have to take all kinds of measures to prevent terrorism. And <br/>the example also illustrates some of the difficulties. It's talking about racial profiling, so it's <br/>discriminatory, making distinction between people with certain faces and features, and that's against <br/>the law in most countries, and for good reasons. But, what about security? What if it really works? <br/>The benefits are many. Still, even if it works, is it proportional? Is it ethical? Well these are important, <br/>difficult and Sensitive questions which we will look at later on. First, let's go back to and have a closer <br/>look at profiling. Where does it come from, and how has it been applied in the past? <br/>
I guess the basic idea behind profiling is the perception among many that criminals and <br/>
terrorists are different from us. Well, last week, we argued that there's no empirical evidence that <br/>suggests that terrorists are crazy. But they could have other personal or behavioral characteristics <br/>that sets them apart from non-terrorists.  Well, whether true or not, it is an important explanation <br/>for the idea that it might be possible to recognize a terrorist.  <br/>
I would like to add that terrorists, themselves, probably think that profiling is possible. <br/>
Because from the early days on terrorists have tried their best not to look suspicious, act normally, <br/>make sure that you, you're not noticed by the police or the secret services. And Jihadists or Islamist <br/>terrorists, for instance, they have used women or Caucasian or white converts or simply tried to <br/>change their appearances, their haircut, their clothes, the way they walk, all in order to not look <br/>suspicious, not fit any profile. <br/>
Besides these human aspects, there is a technological side to the idea that it's possible to <br/>
recognize a terrorist. In recent years the revived interest in Profiling is partly explained by the <br/>possibility today to gather, store and analyze enormous amounts of data thanks to developments in <br/>information technology and the Internet. Profiling however is far from new and there are quite a <br/>number of examples from the past, for instance, in the late 19th century the authorities wanted to <br/>know the true identity of a person who was responsible for the killing of a number of women in <br/>London. Well that person was called in the media Jack the Ripper.  I'm sure that many of you have <br/>heard of Jack the Ripper, well the investigation into that case was considered by many as the starting <br/>point of criminal profiling. <br/>
Another famous historical case is that of the so called Mad Bomber. In November 1940 the <br/>
workers of the Consolidated Edison building in New York found a homemade pipe bomb, and <br/>attached to it was a note and it said, Con Edison crooks, this is for you. Well more than 30 small <br/>bombs in public areas, theaters, phone booths would follow in the years between 1940 and 1956. <br/>And the Mad Bomber escaped the authorities, he alluded the investigators for 16 years. <br/>
And in 1956 the investigators went to a psychiatrist called James Brussell, and they asked him <br/>
to draw up a profile of the suspect, and they gave him all kinds of clues and information of their <br/>investigation. And James Brussell came up with a profiling, a profile which had many elements that <br/>were simply common sense, but he also added some psychological ideas. For instance, he said that <br/>because paranoia tends to peak at around 35, and now we're 16 years later, so he said that the <br/>suspect is probably in his early 50s. Well, his profile proved dead on, and in January 1957, the police <br/>knocked at the door of a person called George Metesky, who was arrested and confessed <br/>immediately. What do we learn from this case? Was it just a lucky shot, or is it really Possible to <br/>discover criminals and terrorists, preferably before they plant any bomb. What about more recent <br/>success in profiling? <br/>
Well in the, one of the early examples of both profiling and data screening is the example or <br/>
the efforts of the German Federal Criminal Police Office or Bundeskriminalamt, and especially its <br/>president, Horst Herold, who in the late 1970s tried to, tried to find the terrorists of the far left <br/>terrorist group called Rote Armee Fraktion, Red Army Faction. Well, they had found out that these <br/>terrorists, they rented their apartments using a false name and in order to protect their identity they <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_3></a>paid their energy bills in cash. So what did the authorities do, they asked For the data of the power <br/>companies to find out what person did pay their bills in cash. And then in a second phase they looked <br/>for they compared this data with the data of the registry office and other agencies to single out <br/>innocent people. And for all the others they knocked on the door of these apartments, and in the end <br/>they found this way a, one apartment, one Rote Armee Fraktion apartment and arrested one of its <br/>members. <br/>
Well, I'm not sure if you want to call this success, as the efforts were huge. And looking for <br/>
other examples in academic literature I soon found out that there are no clear-cut examples of <br/>successful profiling in counter-terrorism. In fact, virtually all important studies By academics say that <br/>personal profiling is impossible. And it's clear now from the academic world, it's linked to many <br/>studies that show that there is no terrorist personality. <br/>
So terrorists are not only not crazy, but they're also not very different from us, at least not <br/>
different enough to make profiling possible. And even if they were very different, we would still be <br/>confronted by, well fortunately, by the fact that there are relatively few terrorists. So that makes it <br/>impossible to create enormous databases with data on individuals. Well, what about this attempt by <br/>the Bundeskriminalamt? That didn't focus on persons and personal characteristics, it fo, it focused on <br/>their behavior. What about this so-called behavioral profiling? Well again, most academics are <br/>highlyskeptical as there are many obstacles to this kind of effort as well as many risks. <br/>
One of the biggest risks is the possibility that incorrect information from profiling can lead to <br/>
so-called false positives or false negatives. And both can have serious consequences. For instance, a <br/>false positive can lead to a situation in which a suspect who appears to fit an incorrect profile is <br/>investigated or even arrested. And the consequences could be that it blocks investigating other leads, <br/>other clues. Or it can even lead to the escape of the person or persons who are responsible for an <br/>attack. And the opposite of a false positive is a false negative. And in that case the profile might <br/>provide information that leads investigators to rule out certain groups while focusing on the wrong <br/>ones. Efforts to profile terrorists in the West in recent years have often proved to be examples of <br/>racial profiling, monitoring Muslims. And we know that not all terrorists are Muslims, as we discussed <br/>last week. Racial profiling has also resulted in false positives and false negatives, but it also has had <br/>considerable ramifications for the individual liberties of the population being monitored. Creating <br/>and fostering stereotypes and the notion of a clash of civilization, or a, a struggle between Islam and <br/>Christianity. <br/>
Well profiling on the base of nationality, ethnicity, race, age, gender also have negative <br/>
consequences for certain groups, or relationships between countries and communities. As a result <br/>profiling can be labeled disproportional, as the enormous efforts have yield few results. There are <br/>many negative side-effects, including risks for counter-terrorism. Adding all up it seems that today <br/>profiling is regarded an impossible endeavor and it is likely to remain so in light of current research. <br/>Therefore, we label the assumption that one can recognize a terrorist by means of profiling false. <br/>More research is needed. <br/>
In sum, there is a demand for a tool to make a distinction between terrorists and non-<br/>
terrorists. And there is a long history in attempts to profile criminals and terrorists. But there are no <br/>clear cut successes. And according to scholars it's, it's almost impossible to to do individual profiling, <br/>personal profiling and they even see a lot of obstacles for behavioral profiling, as there are many <br/>negative side effects as well as risks for counter-terrorism. Therefore we label the assumption that <br/>one can recognize a terrorist as false. In the next video we will explore and Analyze the idea that one <br/>can de-radicalize terrorists. <br/> <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_4></a><b>4.2 Assumption: Deredecalisation is possible <br/></b> <br/>In the previous video, we investigated the idea that we could recognize a terrorist by way of profiling. <br/>In this video we will explore and analyze the assumption that terrorists can be deradicalized. In other <br/>words, we look into the idea that individuals change their attitudes and behavior and leave terrorism <br/>behind. Is that indeed possible, or just wishful thinking? What can we learn from past experience? <br/>And what have scholars and experts to say about this? <br/>
Before we will address these questions, we first have to define the term. What is <br/>
deradicalization? What is meant by this term? Well, deradicalization, like most concepts, can have <br/>different meanings to different people. And I will use the definition by John Horgan, who did a lot of <br/>research into this field, into radicalization and deradicalization. And he regards it as a social and <br/>Psychological process whereby an individual's commitment to, and involvement in violent <br/>radicalization is reduced to the extent that they are no longer at risk of involvement and engagement <br/>in violent activity. The deredicalization can also be understood as a policy or program. <br/>
So not only a process, an individual process or group process but also as a government or civil <br/>
society program. And that program seeks to reverse the Radicalization process for those already are <br/>particularly radicalized or help them to disengage from radical or extreme groups they are involved in <br/>of which they are members. And it's important to say that deradicalization is not radicalization in <br/>reverse. These are two very distinct processes. Who has said that it is possible to deradicalize a <br/>terrorist? According to Angel Rabasa and his colleagues at RAND Washington, this is a simple fact <br/>that can be observed. And in a report in 2013, they stated just as there are processes through which <br/>an individual becomes an extremist, there are also processes through which an extremist comes to <br/>renounce violence, leaves a group or movement, or even rejects a radical worldview. <br/>
Well, the last part is contested. Do people really give up their radical worldviews? Is that <br/>
possible? And is it possible to actively deradicalize persons and, if so, how? Well, these are of course <br/>very important questions for those who fight terrorism, who deal with terrorism. The first proof that <br/>it is possible are individuals who left terrorism behind and who are now involved in counter <br/>radicalization and deradicalization projects. They turn from terrorists into experts that try to help <br/>people to prevent them from joining terrorist organizations. <br/>
Now, within the field of terrorism studies there are a number of them that are quite well <br/>
known. Here, you have three examples of them. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, who worked for a <br/>Wahhabi charity that proved to be an al-Qaeda financier, and who is now director of the Foundation <br/>for the Defense of Democracies, which is based in Washington, and he's a scholar in the field of <br/>terrorism and counterterrorism studies. I'm also proud to say that he's a former guest researcher at <br/>the ICCT Den Haag, just a few offices away from this office. And then Norman Benotman, who was a <br/>leading figure of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group active in Afghanistan. And who is now a senior <br/>analyst at the British Quilliam Foundation. and he, for instance, wrote an open letter to Bin Laden in <br/>2010 recommending him to hold your violence and reconsider your aims and strategy. <br/>
And then an example from Northern Ireland, Henry Robinson, who joined the Official Irish <br/>
Republican Army in 1979. And who left it, and in 1990 was the co-founder of the foundation Families <br/>Against Intimidation and Terror. Besides these individuals who left terrorism behind, also known as <br/>formers or former terrorists, there are deradicalization programs. Well, in general these <br/>deradicalization programs are of two types. The first category focuses on individual ideological <br/>deradicalization using psychological or religious counseling. To produce a change of mind, a change <br/>of attitude, and in the end, also change of behavior. And the second category aims for collective <br/>deradicalization, using for instance, political negotiations to obtain a type of change of behavior. And <br/>it includes measures such as ceasefires or the decommissioning of arms. <br/>
In Europe there are many examples of deradicalization programs that are aimed at right wing <br/>
extremists, especially in the Nordic countries, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, as well as in Germany and <br/>the Netherlands. For instance in Norway an exit model was developed based on research conducted <br/>by [FOREIGN] And this model was also used in Sweden, Where it consists of five phases, from <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_5></a>motivation and disengagement to being re, well, making sure that these people are part of society <br/>again with settlement, reflection, and stabilization. <br/>
And on the other side of the globe in Indonesia, there are quite a number of deradicalization <br/>
programs that mainly are aimed at prisoners. And, some of them, and prisoners were, that were <br/>involved in Jihadi terrorism. And some of them are now closely cooperating with the police. And in <br/>Saudi Arabia such programs also aim mainly at prisoners focus on rehabilitation through religious re-<br/>education and psychological counseling. And then in Colombia, they tried to disengage not only <br/>prisoners, but also active members of the FARC. And the Colombian judiciary tries to facilitate this by <br/>suspending the militant's trial in an attempt to encourage and sustain, their demobilization. <br/>
There the keyword is demobilization, and not deradicalization. But the same idea is the basic <br/>
idea is to make sure that they leave terrorism behind, and perhaps also change their attitudes and <br/>behavior. Well, in other words, many examples from around the world. Each with a different size and <br/>scope, methods and goals. What do experts and academics have to say about deradicalization and <br/>deradicalization programs? <br/>
Well, about five years ago, quite a few of them pointed at a lack of attention, expertise, and <br/>
research into this field. But in recent years there has been an increase in the amount of studies and <br/>the amount of programs that has helped us to gain more insight into the challenges and possibilities <br/>of deradicalization in general and that of programs in particular. it also raises new questions. And an <br/>important one is whether or not one can speak of deradicalization, as defined by John Horgan. When <br/>a person leaves a terrorist group behind, but not his or her radical ideas. Is that deradicalization, or <br/>should we just, call that, call that differently? For instance, label it disengagement and nothing more. <br/>
Well the prevailing opinion today is that leaving terrorism behind does not necessarily mean <br/>
that the person is also deradicalized. He or she can still have very radical ideas and they often have. <br/>And many deradicalization programs are in fact primarily aiming for this idea of leaving terrorism <br/>behind there aiming for disengagment and also much deradicalization. And I guess that that is more <br/>cost effective and also from a point of view from society it should be given more priority as change <br/>behavior matters more then changed ideas. What about the success of these programs? Do they <br/>work, and are they proofof the assumption that it is possible to deradicalize a terrorist? <br/>
John Horgan is skeptical about certain types of programs especially the ones that aim for <br/>
demobilization, defection deescalation and rehabilitation. And in his eyes this is not the same as <br/>deradicalization. Demobilization is not the same as deradicalization. Well I guess he's right and he <br/>seems to suggest that many of the person that goes through these programs might still pose a risk of <br/>involvement and engagement in violent activity in the future. And there are indeed quite a few <br/>examples of graduates of these programs that return to violence, that return to terrorism after they <br/>were released, especially in the case of Saudi Arabia. But it should be noted that the programs in this <br/>particular country were enormous. They processed more than 4000 detainees but there have been a <br/>number of people who after that ended up in the ranks of terrorist organizations. So, successful or <br/>not, well here's an example or study that indicates that there has been some success. <br/>
A survey of deradicalization programs conducted by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue based <br/>
on 30 brief case studies from around the world show that, under certain conditions, programs can be <br/>effective. And they also listed a number of very Interesting recommendations and important lessons <br/>from these cases and one of them is that programs are effective and this is very important when they <br/>are voluntary and that personal commitment is vital. It makes sense, but also the studies show that <br/>that is an very important element. For a copy of this very interesting report well, see the list of <br/>recommended readings. All in all, it's clear that deradicalization is indeed possible. Many people <br/>leave terrorism behind. Some thanks to deradicalization programs And some also leave behind their <br/>radical ideas. <br/>
In sum, we define the term and notice a difference between deradicalization and <br/>
disengagement. We've seen an increase in both the number Of programs, and the number of studies <br/>into this field. Most of the deradicalization programs primarily aim at disengagement rather than <br/>deradicalization. There are successes of individual and group deradicalization Therefore, we regard <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_6></a>the assumption that deradicalization is possible to be true. In the next video, we will investigate the <br/>idea that decapitation of terrorist organizations and terrorist groups work. <br/><b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_7></a><b>4.3 Assumption: Decapitation of terrorist organisations works <br/></b> <br/>In the last video, we discussed whether or not it's possible to deradicalise a terrorist. In this video, we <br/>will look into a harder, tougher and often violent type of counter terrorism measure, which is the <br/>decapitation of terrorist organizations.  So we're not going to look into the beheading of individuals. <br/>We're going to look into the arrest and sometimes killing. Of top leaders of terrorist organizations. <br/>
Well, here are a few examples of groups that have been confronted with this particular <br/>
counter-terrorism measures. The groups include the left-wing, rebellious terrorist organization, FARC, <br/>from Colombia. And one of their leaders was killed in 2011, Alfonso Cano. And then there are quite a <br/>number of examples from France, Spain, with regard to demilitant leaders, the terrorist leaders of <br/>the Basque separatist organization ETA. Many leaders were arrested in 2012 including Izaskun Lesaka, <br/>I'm not sure if I pronounced it well, but one of the top leaders of the ETA.  <br/>
And then of course, you all are aware of that, you all have seen it probably the killing of Al <br/>
Qaeda’s Osama Bin Laden, in Pakistan in operation Neptune Spear which was carried out by Navy <br/>SEALs of the United States in Abbottabad, Pakistan, early May in Pakistan 2011. But a decapitation <br/>strategy or Counterterrorism measure is as old as countering terrorism. Some historical examples <br/>include the arrest of the entire first wave of leaders of the Rote Armee Fraktion in Germany in 1972 <br/>and the arrest of Guzman, the leader of Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path. A leftist terrorist <br/>organization in Peru in 1992, or the arrest of the leader of the Kurdish Workers Party, the PKK, <br/>Abdullah Ocalan who was arrested in Kenya in 1999.  There's several scholars, practitioners, <br/>politicians. That have claimed that decapitation of terrorist organization works.  <br/>
One prominent scholar that looked into this particular instrument is Brian Price. Who, in <br/>
2012, wrote the following. He wrote, decapitation tactics which are designed to kill or capture the <br/>key leader or leaders. Of a terrorist group feature prominently in counterterrorism strategies of <br/>many states, including Israel and United States. It's a widely practiced counterterrorism measure <br/>that's been used around the globe. And after successful arrests or killing of key leaders it's a very <br/>often that politicians claim this success, they state now the terrorist organization has been dealt a big <br/>blow. Here are a number of examples. <br/>
The first is from Spain from the then Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero, who in 2008 reacted <br/>
after the arrest of the operational chief of the ETA, the Basque separatists terrorist organization. And <br/>he said that with this arrest, ETA has suffered a severe blow in its organization and capability. And he <br/>also said, today, ETA is weaker. An example from South America. The Colombian president, Juan <br/>Manuel Santos, after the killing of the FARC leader Alphonso Cano in 2011. He said that the killing of <br/>Cano is the hardest blow to this organization in its entire history. And then finally, the reaction after <br/>the killing of Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda. <br/>
Well here is the reaction of by Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York who was the <br/>
mayor of that city in 2001. And after the killing of Osama Bin Laden he said the following. He said he <br/>was a symbol more than anything else right now, but symbols are important. In the long run this will <br/>be very helpful to us in defeating Islamic terrorism. In the long run, this is a much bigger step than <br/>people realize. Why do many influential people think that decapitation works? Well those who <br/>regard it as an effective strategy assume that the successive terrorist organization highly depends on <br/>effective leadership. So when you kill the leader, you will weaken the organization. <br/>
Well, this might be the case when a leadership struggle occurs after the death of a leader. An <br/>
organization might need to devote a lot of time and energy to choose a new leader and at the same <br/>time they're not able to carry out a tax. Or it's possible that they cannot find a new leader because <br/>others don't have the right capabilities or the right amount of experience to do so. And it could also <br/>be related to ideas and theories about Charismatic Leadership. Some leaders, especially those of <br/>religiously inspired groups, play a crucial role on explaining and safeguarding the groups ideology. <br/>Leaders like Osama Bin Laden or the leader of the Japanese Aum Sect.  <br/>
for instance, being perceived as highly charismatic and a hero to some. Many people <br/>
therefore think that it is very effective to eliminate those leaders because it will destabilize the <br/>organization, but it will also weaken its appeal. Why is it important to investigate whether or not <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_8></a>decapitation of terrorist organizations works? I mentioned that many influential people say it does <br/>and must be practiced around the globe, but there are serious legal and ethical sides to it, especially <br/>when it, it, it concerns the killing of individuals. That's why we need to evaluate the effectiveness. <br/>Are terrorist organizations indeed weakened because of the arrest or killing of some of its leaders? <br/>Or do they simply continue to exist, or even grow stronger? And what about human rights? <br/>
Let us look into these questions with the help of empirical evidence And academic literature. <br/>
Let me present a study by Jenna Jordan from 2009. It has the interesting title, When Heads Roll: <br/>Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Decapitation. In this study she investigated 300 cases of <br/>leadership decapitation between 1945 and 2004. And she coded decapitation as a success, when the <br/>terrorist organization was inactive for two years following that event. And she says that the key <br/>elements in assessing the effectiveness of that act are age of the group, size of the group and the <br/>type of the group. And she found that the younger and smaller the groups the more often they are <br/>destabilized and that older and larger groups face less consequences. Religiously inspired terrorist <br/>organizations seem to be more or less resilient to decapitation according to Jordan. Separatist groups <br/>remained active in Almost 90% of decapitation cases where only a third of ideologically ideological <br/>organizations such as left wing and right wing organizations. Are damaged by it. And then, in general, <br/>in 17% of the cases. So 7% of the cases, decapitation led to the collapse of an organization. Well, that <br/>sounds interesting. But when comparing this figure with data of non-decapitated groups She finds <br/>out that decapitated groups do not have a particular higher decline rate. So she therefore concludes <br/>that Decapitation is not an effective counter-terrorism measure. And she also lists a number of side <br/>effects such as the strengthening of the group's resolve. They grow stronger because of it. results in <br/>retaliation, they are very angry because of it and increased public, increase of public sympathy for <br/>the organization. <br/>
Well let's now have a look at a more recent study, the one by Brian Price. In 2012, he said the <br/>
following. In Targeting Top Terrorists: How Leadership Decapitation Contributes to Counterterrorism, <br/>he said that the measure has a prominent place in many counterterrorism strategies and he shows <br/>why this is actually a good thing. Price starts with the literature review on decapitation and he shows <br/>that most. Academics say that is not effective or even counter-productive. And he also argues that its <br/>mainly caused by the focus of the study, the relatively short-term effects, like Jordan's study, a time <br/>arising of two years. He says that is too short, to really measure and appreciate the impact of <br/>decapitation. The theoretical argument is that decapitation of terrorist groups could be successful, <br/>because terrorist organizations are different from other organizations. They are violent, clandestine <br/>and values-based. Simply put, leader of these types of these organizations, compared to nonviolent, <br/>profit based organizations, businesses, etc... are more important. They need to be friends as <br/>charismatic and succession is more difficult, because of the clandestine nature and the fact that <br/>personal characteristics, and personal ideology cannot easily be replaced. <br/>
He then tested this theoretical argument to see the effects of leadership decapitation on the <br/>
mortality of terrorist organizations. And this led to six conclusions of which the following four are the <br/>most striking ones. Price observes that in the long run decapitated groups have a significantly higher <br/>mortality rate then non decapitated groups and it says that although only 30% of the decapitated <br/>groups ended. Within two years, which was the time horizon of Jenna Jordan, he says that Indians, <br/>they have a significantly higher mortality rate. And the earlier the leadership decapitation occurs in <br/>the life cycle of that group, the more effective it will be. And he also says that the size of the group, <br/>doesn't have any impact on its duration. <br/>
And then finally, he says that religious terrorist groups were less resilient and easier to <br/>
destroy than nationalist groups, which is very much in line with his observation about the importance <br/>of leaders of these groups. the leaders of these groups play an important role in framing and in <br/>interpreting the organizational goals and strategies. <br/>
And this leads to the following conclusion. Price says that, states, that are willing to employ <br/>
leadership decapitation. As part of their counter terrorism strategy. Should target terrorist group <br/>leaders as early as possible. These are just two important examples of studies that look into the <br/>effectiveness of decapitation. The authors arrive at different conclusions. Jordan says it's not <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_9></a>effective, while Price says it is. But both point at the importance to look at the features of the <br/>organizations, the differences. Between the organizations as it might have, or it's important for <br/>potential effectiveness of certain CT measures, in this case decapitation. this might be the most <br/>important lesson we can draw from these two studies. <br/>
The success of decapitation, like many other measures, depends on the context. It's context-<br/>
dependent. It might work in one case, it might backfire in another. And there's certainly not one size <br/>fits all solution. Successful examples are the arrest of the leaders of Aum Sect in Japan and that of the <br/>leader of the Shining Path in Peru and that of the Real Irish Republican Army. But almost or entirely <br/>cease their Terrorist activities after their leaders were killed or captured. But we also have <br/>unsuccessful examples and that includes the decapitation attempts, for instance, by Israel of Hamas <br/>and that of the Rote Armee Fraktion in Germany. And then there are still one important aspect of <br/>this assumption that has not been addressed so far and that's the human rights dimension. This is <br/>particularly important dimension with regards to the drone attacks that are frequently used by the <br/>United States to in its war on terror. To decapitate organizations like the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and <br/>Al Qaeda related organizations. <br/>
Many high ranking leaders have been killed in these strikes. Is it a success or not? Can we just <br/>
now simply measure what the effect is of the organization? Will it seize, will it destabilize or not? <br/>These drone strikes are not without controversy, as civilians have been killed. for instance, according <br/>to a highly critical report by Stanford University and New York University and this report also states <br/>that publicly available evidence that the strikes have made United States safer overall is ambiguous <br/>at best. <br/>
It seems when determining the effectiveness of decapitation, either by drones or whatever <br/>
type of instrument, we also need to know more about the short-term and long-term negative side <br/>effects, and we should not only look at simply at, will it destabilize an organization or not? There's <br/>more to that. The side effects are important. <br/>
To sum up. There is a variety of reasons to doubt the effectiveness of decapitation of <br/>
terrorist organizations. The success depends on the type of organizations that are attacked, and the <br/>modus operandi that are used. Are we talking about the arrests of leaders or the killing of persons by <br/>way of drone attacks? And of course it depends on how you measure success. But I guess in some <br/>cases. Decapitation of terrorist organizations does work. And that's why we label this as assumption <br/>as partly true. But again, more research is needed. In the next video, we will investigate the idea that, <br/>terrorism cannot be defeated. <br/><b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_10></a><b>4.4 Assumption: Terrorism cannot be defeated <br/></b> <br/>In the last video we discussed whether or not decapitation of terrorist organizations is a successful <br/>counter-terrorism measure. In this video we will explore the assumption that terrorism cannot be <br/>defeated. It is related to the assumption we discussed last week about the success of terrorism but in <br/>this case we look at the effectiveness of counter terrorism measures. And defeated we have defined <br/>in a classical way, as having been beaten in a battle or other contest. This means that some other <br/>party has to be actively and intentionally involved. And in this case we're talking about defeat by <br/>counter-terrorism measures or counter-terrorism actors. But who or what is exactly defeated? Are <br/>we talking about the phenomenon of terrorism or about individual terrorist groups? Well actually we <br/>will look at both. <br/>
First we will focus on the possibility of defeating terrorist groups and after that we will come <br/>
back and see whether or not the phenomenon of terrorism as a whole can be defeated. Who has <br/>said terrorism cannot be defeated? Well, actually quite a few experts and important politicians and <br/>public figures. For instance, general Sir David Richards, Chief of the Defense Staff of the British Armed <br/>Forces. In 2010 regarding defeating Al Qaeda and Islamist militancy he said first of all you have to ask <br/>do we need to defeat it in the sense of a clear cut victory and I would argue that it is unnecessary and <br/>would never be achieved.  <br/>
For that last part is, of course, not very hopeful. Especially not when stated by a top general. <br/>
And then former US President George Bush. In 2004 he was asked can we win the war on terror? And <br/>he replied I don't think you can win it but I think you can create conditions so that those who use <br/>terror as a tool are less acceptable in parts of the world. So there's no winning of the war on terror. <br/>Even by, said by US President George W. Bush, who was, in many ways, the architect of that whole <br/>concept. And then King Abdullah the second of Jordan. Also in 2010 he said we're never going to be <br/>able to get rid of terrorism because there is always going to be evil in the world. Well, is he right? Is <br/>he wrong? That's what we're going to find out in this video. Why is it important to investigate this <br/>idea, this assumption? <br/>
Well, if you believe that terrorism cannot be defeated this could lead to defeatism and <br/>
strengthen the idea that terrorism poses a big threat which we can do very little. That scares us and <br/>that's what terrorists want. And then in terms of CT measures if terrorism indeed cannot be defeated <br/>this implies that we should primarily focus on prevention. Make sure terrorist groups don't emerge. <br/>Or especially focus on managing the impact of terrorism. Com, if it's there you cannot stop it so make <br/>sure that if it hits us the impact is as little as possible. I mentioned that aim to stop terrorists, or <br/>terrorist organization, is not very useful if this assumption is really true. How can we measure <br/>defeat? To determine whether or not a terrorist organization has been defeated in a battle or <br/>contest we have to determine whether or not this was caused by counter-terrorism measures. For <br/>instance, by disruption, decapitation nor by mobilizing communities that said no to this particular <br/>group or network. And if that terrorist organization has ceased to exist because of other reasons we <br/>cannot say it's been defeated. And we know that individual terrorist groups and even waves of <br/>terrorism can fade out because of many other reasons. <br/>
Well one scholar who has observed this is David Rapoport. And he distinguished, we <br/>
discussed that earlier, four waves of terrorism. And he concluded that these waves after a few <br/>decades gradually peter out. But he also gives an example of a defeated type of terrorism. He said <br/>that revolutionary terrorists were defeated in one country after another. So a very famous scholar <br/>actually referring to defeat not only of one group but of a whole type of terrorism. And he referred to <br/>the third or new left wave of terrorism. But how did he measure this? How can he be sure that the <br/>ending of these terrorist groups, or even this wave, was the result of counter-terrorism measures? <br/>And can we consider that a defeat, a defeat of terrorism? <br/>
One study that systematically analyzed how terrorism ends is the study by Seth Jones and <br/>
Martin Libicki of the Rand Corporation. They investigated 648 terrorist groups that were active in the <br/>period 1968 2006 and they looked at the way they ended. And in their report, published in 2008, <br/>they distinguished four major reasons for the ending of these groups. They were reasons why they <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_11></a>ceased to exist. The first reason is because of local police and intelligence services. And the second <br/>reason is because of military force. A third reason is that terrorists joined the political process. They <br/>joined, for instance, negotiations or something else. We'll come back to that later. <br/>
Then the fourth reason is because terrorist groups were victorious. They manage to achieve <br/>
their stated political goals. And Jones and Libicki also touched upon a Fifth minor reason and that is <br/>the splintering of terrorist organizations. It means that a certain group ends but it doesn't signal the <br/>end of terrorism by its members and it's therefore excluded from further analysis. Well, let us have a <br/>closer look at these four major explanations. Do they provide reasons to challenge the assumption <br/>that terrorism cannot be defeated? Have the groups, investigated by Jones and Libicki, ended <br/>because of successful counter-terrorism measures? In other words, have they been defeated or not? <br/>
The first major reason why terrorist groups end, according to the Rand report, is because of <br/>
the work of local police and intelligence services. Their counter-terrorism measures include <br/>disruption, the collection of information on terrorist groups, penetrating cells and arresting key <br/>leaders. And developing anti-terrorism legislation and criminalization of certain activities is also part <br/>of this major explanation for the end of terrorist groups. And decapitation of, of terrorist <br/>Organizations which we mentioned in the previous video in the form of arrests of leaders is also part <br/>of it. <br/>
Well the Rand report concludes that a wide variety of measures that can be labeled policing <br/>
contributes indeed contributes to the end of terrorist organizations. In fact, it says that 40% of the <br/>cases in which terrorism groups end were because of policing. What about the second major reason <br/>why terrorism ends? The use of military force. Well this particular counter-terrorism measure or <br/>approach of course, involves the use of military forces to kill or capture terrorist members or to fight <br/>against states that support terrorism. Well according to the Rand Report, sometimes the threat of <br/>the use of force or constant surveillance can already be enough to make sure that terrorist <br/>organizations are always on the run. <br/>
However, this age old way of fighting terrorism is not particularly effective. According to the <br/>
report only 7% of the terrorist groups that have ended since 1968 did so because of military force. <br/>Only 7% of the cases. But this limited success is related to the fact that terrorists are, of course, not <br/>armies and they are very small and they don't employ like conventional forces. Unless they fight an <br/>insurgency. Report also shows that the use of massive, massive military power could alienate a local <br/>population and therefore be counterproductive. The third major reason why terrorism ends is <br/>because terrorist organizations join a political process. Or the possibility for them to enter such a <br/>process depends on the goals of these organizations. And according to Rand, the narrower the goals <br/>the more difficult it is for terrorists to achieve them and the more likely terrorist groups may be <br/>willing to seek nonviolent means. <br/>
Well the decision to join a political process is the result of a cost benefit analysis and the <br/>
conclusion of that analysis that pursuing the goals through politics has greater benefits and lower <br/>cost than using violent means. So it's a smarter may a way, a more cost efficient way to achieve goals. <br/>Well, such a step happens more often than many people assume I guess. Of all the analyzed endings <br/>of terrorist Organizations 43% of the cases were caused by the fact that they joined a political <br/>process. 43% of the cases according to the Rand report that looked into 648 cases. <br/>
Well does that mean they are defeated? We're interested in that question as our assumption <br/>
is ca, terrorists cannot be defeated. Is this an example of a defeat or not? Well I'm not sure about it. <br/>Defeat implies that there is a winner and a loser. A move into politics as such cannot be called a <br/>defeat. Not a defeat for a terrorist organization but it could be argued that it is a defeat for terrorism <br/>as an instrument because they realize that they can reach their goals in a better way by using non-<br/>violent means. So maybe you can call it a defeat of the tool of terrorism. <br/>
On the other hand, there are also cases in which terrorist organizations were invited to join a <br/>
political process actually because of the use of violence. And in these cases one could argue that use <br/>of violence was rewarded and therefore successful. The fourth, and last, major reason for the ending <br/>of terrorist groups is that they are victorious. Well, according to Rand, in 10% of the cases terrorist <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_12></a>organizations were successful in reaching their stated political goals and ceased their activities <br/>afterwards. <br/>
Obviously, this type of ending does not challenge the idea that terrorism cannot be defeated. <br/>
On the contrary. It strengthens the idea that terrorism can be successful. However, the figures are <br/>relatively low. 10%. I would say it's 10% too many but it also shows that the overwhelming majority <br/>of terrorist groups do not achieve their political goals. They are not successful. So according to the <br/>Rand report there are four major reasons why terrorist organizations end. Policing, military force, <br/>politics, and victory. Well of all the terrorist groups that ended 40% did so because of policing and 7% <br/>because of military force. I think that these two figures clearly support the argument that terrorism <br/>can be defeated. Together they explain almost half of the cases in which terrorist groups ended. And <br/>the process of joining politics proves that terrorist organizations can move from to non-violent <br/>means to pursue their goals. And this could be partly the effect of Certain counter terrorism <br/>measures but you cannot call it a defeat. Not in all cases. This depends but there are a number of <br/>cases where governments more or less forced these organizations to join a political process. <br/>
And there are examples where these terrorists actually forced the government to allow them <br/>
to have a seat at the negotiation table. If we look at this data the assumption that terrorism, meaning <br/>terrorist organizations, cannot be defeated is clearly false and I think you could even label it a myth. <br/>Fortunately, these actors can be defeated By counter terrorism measures ranging from policing and <br/>the use of military force to forcing them or talking them into joining a political process. <br/>
However, if you look at the phenomenon of terrorism as a whole we must conclude that it <br/>
cannot be defeated. For instance, David Rapoport shows that there are successive waves of terrorism <br/>and that it takes a long time for each wave to fade out. And he also shows that even then they do not <br/>die out completely.  Even today you still have a few anarchists around. But if we, but we can speed <br/>up these processes by defeating individual groups and networks. And I believe it's important to stress <br/>this. <br/>
Especially against a background of much pessimism and defeatism about the possibilities to <br/>
force large organizations like Al Qaeda or the FARC in Columbia, to force them to end their activities. <br/>It will not be easy but it is not impossible. As, for instance, the study of Rand has shown. Well <br/>depending on your interpretation of the assumption that terrorism cannot be defeated we can label <br/>it a myth or partly true. It's a myth when looking at many cases in which terrorist organizations were <br/>in fact defeated. It can be labelled partly true if one looks at the phenomenon as a whole. <br/>Unfortunately the idea of a world without terrorism is quite a utopian one. But again, individual <br/>terrorist organizations can be defeated. <br/>
To summarize, we looked at statements that support the idea that terrorism cannot be <br/>
defeated. But both the article by Rapoport and The Rand Report show that at one point in time, <br/>terrorist groups ceased to exist and that they can be defeated. The phenomenon of terrorism as a <br/>whole, however, cannot be defeated. So, depending on your interpretation of the assumption, you <br/>can either label it a myth or partly true. In the next video we will investigate the assumption that <br/>terrorism can best be dealt with by way of a holistic or comprehensive approach. <br/><b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_13></a><b>4.5 Assumption: Terrorism can best be managed by a holistic approach <br/></b> <br/>In the last video, we discussed the assumption that terrorism cannot be defeated. This video focuses <br/>on the attempts to deal with terrorism. And many have said that this is best done Or best dealt with <br/>by way of a holistic or comprehensive approach. Well, let us compare that assumption with empirical <br/>evidence and expert and scholarly literature. <br/>
Let me first explain what is meant with a holistic approach in counter terrorism. Which is also <br/>
often referred to as a Comprehensive approach, or a wide approach, or a grand strategy. Well, the <br/>latter term has been defined by Martha Crenshaw as a more inclusive conception that explains how a <br/>state's full range of resources can be adapted to achieve national security. So a full range of <br/>resources to achieve national security. Well in general, descriptions of a holistic or comprehensive <br/>approach to terrorism or any other complex societal problem often includes is, includes the phrase <br/>involving a wide range of instruments or involving a wide range of actors. And with regard to <br/>terrorism, it often includes the words preventive and repressive measures or soft and hard measures <br/>or soft and hard approaches. <br/>
Well, in addition, it frequently refers to the need to deal with the complexity and <br/>
multidimensional nature of both terrorism and counterterrorism. And most descriptions of the <br/>approach list a range of concrete policy areas from the procurement of intelligence to the <br/>prosecution of perpetrators of terrorist attacks. And the question remains, whether or not such a <br/>wide approach is the best way to deal with terrorism. Well, there are quite a number of Important <br/>politicians and well known public figures, that have stressed the importance or stressed the need for <br/>a holistic approach or a comprehensive approach to deal with terrorism. <br/>
One of them is the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. In remarks delivered to <br/>
the United Nations security counsels open debate on combating terrorism in Africa. He said that the <br/>success in the combat Against groups such as the Nigeria based Boko Haram or Al Qaeda in the <br/>Islamic Maghreb and the Somalia based Al Shabaab would require greater and more holistic efforts. <br/>And he said, and here's a quote, military advances, important as they are, will not themselves bring <br/>an end to terrorism in Africa. This struggle must go forward on many fronts, including addressing the <br/>conditions that are conducive to the spread of terrorism. And Mr Ban Ki-moon added that the lack of <br/>development and the absence of the rule of law allowed terrorists to recruit across the communities <br/>and build their ranks. Also Pakistan's prime minister stressed the importance of a holistic approach to <br/>deal with terrorism. <br/>
At the ceremony at the National Police Academy in Islamabad in February 2013 Raja Pervez <br/>
Ashraf said amongst others, we have to adopt a holistic approach to combat the menace. I urge <br/>police to maintain close relationships with the local community. Interaction with the community <br/>would not only provide police information about anti-national and anti-social elements, but also <br/>deny criminals refuge. This is only possible if they, and he means the police, are not feared but <br/>respected. And the plea of Ban Ki-moon, and the Pakistan prime minister for comprehensive <br/>approach, are very much in line with the counter terrorism approach of the United Nations as <br/>formulated in 2006. In September of that year, the General Assembly unanimously adopted the <br/>United Nations Global Counterterrorism strategy. Well, this strategy is the first ever comprehensive, <br/>collective, and internationally approved framework to tackle the problem of terrorism, and it consists <br/>of four parts, or four pillars. Well, the first pillar is addressing conditions conducive to the spread of <br/>terrorism. <br/>
And the second pillar says, preventing and combating terrorism. And then, it also strengthens <br/>
the need for building states capacity to prevent and combat terrorism, and strengthen the United <br/>Nations systems role in this regard. <br/>
And, then finally, it says, insuring respect for human rights, and the rule of law, our <br/>
fundamental are the fundamental bases of the fight against terrorism. Well with these pillars, the <br/>strategy anchors the United Nation's counter terrorism work in to the broader agenda of this <br/>organization. That is active on many fronts, many areas and in many countries. And it also says the <br/>four pillars approach, according to the United Nations itself. Also encourages member states who <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_14></a>take Similarly integrated approaches to counterterrorism on the national level. In other words, with <br/>this document, the United Nations suggest that other countries, or countries in general, should also <br/>take a holistic approach when dealing with terrorism. What about counterterrorism approaches at <br/>national levels. Let us have a look at the Indonesian example, the Indonesian, the Indonesian white <br/>or holistic approach. <br/>
An approach that has been studied very much by scholars both in Indonesia and outside <br/>
Indonesia but here you have the opinion of an Indonesia scholar, Noorhaidi Hasan. And he said that <br/>Indonesia, in recent years, has developed a model for responding to Islamist radicalization and <br/>terrorism that carefully combines hard and soft measures. And the main approach shifted from one <br/>Base on maintaining security with an important role for the military to one base on law enforcement <br/>in which the police is the lead agency. <br/>
Nevertheless, the hard approach is still very important and not without controversy. <br/>
Indonesia special forces counter terrorism squad, in 2010 alone, arrested 100 people and killed 16. <br/>And the latter of course raised questions By human rights organizations, both at home and abroad. <br/>But notwithstanding these concerns Indonesia today is less prone to serious terrorist attacks than it <br/>was in the early 2000s, and that's partly thanks to the hard approach. However, the police also <br/>achieved a degree of success with soft measures such as their deradicalization programs for <br/>detainees. I already mentioned them in an earlier video. <br/>
Well these programs have led to leading militants working with the police and other <br/>
authorities. And as part of their holistic approach, the Indonesian authorities also, very much <br/>welcomed, the role of civil society. That has been working with grass-roots level to strengthen <br/>people's awareness to and resilience a, against the threats posed by radicals and terrorists that seek <br/>to, infect local populations with violent ideologies. And according to Noorhaidi Hasan, the Indonesian <br/>experience is not only very interesting but also valuable to other countries. But how do we know the <br/>approach by the Indonesians, or the United Nations Global Counter Terrorism strategy works? Or in <br/>other words how to test the assumption that terrorism can best be dealt with by way of a holistic or <br/>comprehensive approach. How to measure that? <br/>
Well, let us first have a look what experts and scholars have to say about this. For instance, <br/>
Bruce Hoffman, one of the leading scholars in the field of terrorism and counterterrorism studies, in <br/>his testimony before the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security of the United States <br/>House of Representatives, that took place Two weeks after 9/11 stated that only a comprehensive or <br/>holistic approach will work. And he said the articulation and development of a comprehensive, fully <br/>coordinated national strategy is not simply an intellectual exercise. But must be at the foundation of <br/>any effective counterterrorism policy. But failure to do so he said to this US House of Representatives <br/>has undermined the counterterrorism effort of other democratic nations. And referring to the <br/>aftermath of the 9/11 attacks Hoffman said, what is now therefore clearly needed is a <br/>comprehensive effort that seeks to knit together more tightly, and provide greater organizational <br/>guidance and focus to the formidable array of capabilities and instruments the U.S. can bring <br/>together. Or can, can bring to bear in the struggle against terrorism. I guess the key words here are <br/>cooperation, coordination, as well as focus. <br/>
Also in my home country, the Netherlands, both authorities and many scholars seem to <br/>
agree on a need for holistic, or comprehensive approach. And the Netherlands national counter <br/>terrorism strategy. I got a copy of it here. The National Counterterrorism Strategy 2011, 2015 of the <br/>national coordinator for counter terrorism is clearly based on the assumption that terrorism can best <br/>be dealt with by way of a comprehensive approach. Well, it's main point of departure is that an <br/>effective approach to terrorism can only succeed if not only the acts of violence themselves are <br/>tackled, but also the process that preceded these acts. <br/>
And of course, different responses of a more repressive nature are required for those who <br/>
have already taken steps towards being prepared to commit violence and of course especially for <br/>those who are on the point of doing so. Thus, this strategy combines both preventive and repressive <br/>measures as part of a Dutch comprehensive approach. It sounds good, but does it really work? Some <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4_15></a>experts and scholars are not so sure Terrorism is best dealt with by way of a holistic approach. And <br/>the following arguments have been put forward by various authors. <br/>
The first is the problem of a comprehensive strategy is that it does not prioritize a finite <br/>
amount of resources and attention. Nor does it provide an assessment of what is most likely to be <br/>effective or what not. And then second, it also tends to overlook the enormous pressure on <br/>governments and agencies to do something here and now. While a comprehensive approach is <br/>needed to prevent terrorism in the long run, traditional and ad hoc security measures that detect, <br/>deter, and disrupt terrorist operations still remain a critical component in the fight against terrorism. <br/>
And finally, and perhaps the most important criticism is that it's easier said than done. I <br/>
mentioned it before. It sounds good but does it work? A comprehensive approach, a wide approach, <br/>a holistic approach. Well, more often than not such comprehensive approaches leave very important <br/>questions unanswered like who is responsible and who takes the lead. Who has the financial and <br/>political means? Or how to make all these various actors and instruments to cooperate etcetera. <br/>Again, this also seems to make sense, so who is right Ban Ki-moon and others who support the idea <br/>of a comprehensive approach or those that have a more skeptical take on this. How to measure the <br/>effectiveness of holistic approaches to counterterrorism. And how to compare these approaches <br/>with others more one dimensional approaches. <br/>
Well, that brings us to one of the most striking and more serious flaws in both <br/>
counterterrorism and the study of counterterrorism. And that is the lack of evaluation studies. Well, <br/>in 2006 three authors, Lum, Kennedy and Sherley published an often quoted article in which they <br/>were looking for evaluation research. And they found out that there's almost a Complete absence of <br/>high quality, scientific evaluation evidence on counterterrorism strategies. Academia has produced <br/>very little to evaluate strategies, measures, etcetera. This is an article for 2006, but it still holds today. <br/>
Unfortunately, this is also the case with regard to governmental studies and reports. Despite <br/>
the fact that governments have spent millions, billions on counterterrorism many resources, few of <br/>them have looked into the effectiveness of their policies and approaches. And it should be <br/>mentioned of course that effectiveness of counterterrorism measures is hard to assess. Even when <br/>focusing on an individual measure. And the idea of assessing a country's holistic or comprehensive <br/>approach with all its instruments and all its actors is of course, very difficult. <br/>
Where does that lead us when trying to answer the question, whether or not terrorism can <br/>
best be dealt with by way of a holistic or comprehensive approach. Well, there is relatively little <br/>empirical evidence. But most scholars seem to agree that terrorism requires a wide, holistic, or <br/>comprehensive approach, or grand strategies. And against that background, I guess, we should label <br/>the assumption as partly true. But let me immediately add that, more research is needed, especially <br/>evaluation studies. What did we learn? <br/>
First we described the notion of a holistic approach to counterterrorism which goes under <br/>
different names. We also observed that many politicians and scholars. I believe there is a need for a <br/>wide or holistic approach to deal with terrorism, but we also saw that there are few evaluation <br/>studies and that there is not much empirical evidence that clearly shows that such a comprehensive <br/>or holistic approach is indeed the most effective approach Nonetheless, we labeled the assumption <br/>partly true. <br/>
Next week we will discuss the implications of what we've learned this week and the previous <br/>
ones, for dealing with terrorism. How can we apply those insights? And what can we learn from past <br/>experience and the academic literature in order to decrease the threat of terrorism, and to limit its <br/>impacts on politics and society. <br/> <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5_1></a><b>5.1 Past weeks and this week <br/></b>  <br/>Hello. Welcome to the fifth and final week of this Coursera course, in which we will build upon that <br/>what we've learned in the previous sessions. Focus on the implications of what we've learned. And <br/>look into the future of terrorism. Let me first briefly go back to the previous sessions. In week one, <br/>we explored the definition And essence of terrorism and looked into the question why there is no <br/>generally accepted definition. And also its implications. <br/>
We also discussed the phrase, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. And the <br/>
politically sensitive issue of listing terrorist organizations. These black lists of designated terrorist <br/>organization. In week two, we Looked at the, state of the art of terrorism studies, and I explained <br/>why it is so difficult to do research on terrorism and counter terrorism. And then in week three we <br/>explored and discussed five assumptions on terrorism. And in the previous week, we explored five <br/>assumptions on counter-terrorism. <br/>
Well in these four different sessions, I observed a need for further study on certain topics, <br/>
the lack of consensus about certain assumptions and persisting challenges for policy makers. And <br/>therefore in this final session we're first going to make an inventory of unanswered questions, un and <br/>under research topics and these persisting challenges to policy makers. Well next I would like to <br/>focus on two key Issues that in my eyes are very important and deserve more attention. And the first <br/>one is the impact of fear of terrorism, and how we can limit the impact of terrorism-related incidents. <br/>And the second subject is to look at Trends and developments in terrorism in order to shape <br/>tomorrow's counter terrorism policies, as well as research into terrorism and counter terrorism. <br/> <br/>
 <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5_2></a><b>5.2 Underresearched topics <br/></b> <br/>Hello. In this video, we will look at what we do not know, or know too little of. Or in other words, we <br/>will focus on unanswered questions. On and under research topics, ongoing debates and persisting <br/>challenges. Of course, I'm not the only scholar that Has pointed at shortcomings in the field of <br/>terrorism studies. <br/>
In week two, I quoted Magnus Ranstorp, Andrew Silke, and Alex Schmid, who have produced <br/>
valuable publications on the state of the art of terrorism studies, as well as have provided criticism <br/>with regard to what has been produced since 9/11. And Alex Schmid is also one of the directors of <br/>the Terrorism Research Initiative that aims to promote research into topics that are not fashionable. <br/>And he came up with a list of 50 un and under research topics in the field of terrorism. <br/>
Have a look at a list. A number of topics on this list actually closely connected to what some <br/>
of you have talked about in the discussion forum. Let me give you a few examples. For instance topic <br/>number three on the List by Alex Schmid, is unwanted and unexpected side and boomerang effects, <br/>or blow back effects, of counter terrorism and ways to recognize it or to minimize it. Well think of the <br/>debate about the use of drones. <br/>
Another example of an un-and-under researched topic is the one that relate to the media the <br/>
internet and terrorism. How are they how do they impact each other. And what can be done about <br/>them while upholding the freedom of speech, the freedom of expression. Its number 18 on the list. <br/>
And we also observed a lot of discussion about state human rights violation as part of <br/>
counter terrorism policies. It's been regarded as an important, under-researched topic especially <br/>with regard to their question, how widespread is, is this and how serious is this phenomenon. And <br/>it's number 34 on the list of Alex Schmid. <br/>
And then, finally, a more recent under-researched topic is related to also a more recent <br/>
phenomenon, the so called Arab awakening. And it's important to look at its implications for <br/>cooperation in the field of counter terrorism and its implications in general. An important more <br/>recent topic, number 48 on the list. Personally, I hope to contribute to two under-researched topics <br/>number nine, number ten. Our topic number nine is about warning the public and responsible crisis <br/>communication prior, during, and after a terrorist attack. What are lessons learned. Well, it’s the <br/>focus of one of the next videos. <br/>
And the same holds for topic number 10, which is about resilience. How can we strengthen <br/>
public resilience. What are policies of certain states and Alex Schmid mentions Columbia Israel and <br/>the United States. But we can also learn from other countries That have been confronted with either <br/>devastating attacks or many attacks. Think of Iraq, Pakistan, India or Russia. Again, also this is a topic <br/>for the next video. But before we will focus on these two Topics let me add one more to the list of <br/>un-and-under-researched topics. Issue number 51, in my eyes, should be about the gap between <br/>policy makers and academia. There is a lack of contacts. They live maybe partly in different worlds. <br/>
And what are the implications of that for both the quality of research, and the quality of <br/>
policy making? Well, here in the Hague, we have the International Center for Counter-Terrorism. <br/>That was partly established just, just About the main idea of bridging that particular gap. And the first <br/>director of that institute is Peter Knoope. Let's see what he has to say about the gap between policy <br/>makers and academia. <br/> <br/>“Thank you Edwin. Thank you for that question. I think bridging the gap between the Policy worlds <br/>and the academic worlds is really important. If the one wants to use the answers that the other one <br/>generates, if the academic world wants to respond to the real questions from the policy worlds, then <br/>bridging that gap is really important. And why there is a gap, is because they live in different <br/>dynamics, they live in different worlds. <br/>
The policy world is determined by the spirit of the media, parliament, the general public that <br/>
wants responses to the threats, to the attacks, to the terrorist incidents now, immediately. Or the <br/>academic world obviously has a Different dynamic and a different way of responding to questions. If <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5_3></a>the one wants to understand the other, then they need to come together and get to know each <br/>other's worlds.  <br/>
Getting to know each other's world means living in the other world for, for some time, <br/>
coming together in the same room, in the same environment and talk to one another. And try to <br/>really feel empathy and understand what the other needs are. <br/>
Translating the policy needs into academic questions is a real challenge. Policy workers, <br/>
policy people don't always understand how you can translate what they need to know into a real <br/>academic researchable question. Coming together in meetings, in exchanges of personal, in <br/>exchanges of knowledge and the dynamics of each other's world is really important.” <br/> <br/>Thank you, Peter. For more information about the International Center for Counter-Terrorism - The <br/>Hague, have a look at their website. As mentioned earlier, bridging the gap between policy makers <br/>and scholars is also very important to me. In fact, it would be my topic number 51 on an extended list <br/>of un-and-under-researched topics in the field of terrorism studies. <br/>
To sum up, there are several issues in the field of terrorism and counter-terrorism that need <br/>
more attention and more research, both from scholars and policy makers. And the list provided by <br/>Alex Schmid is a very useful one. Please have a close look at it. I hope it will inspire some of you when <br/>Doing research on terrorism or when contributing to this course discussion forum. To conclude, I <br/>would like to stress that the list by Alex Schmid is also a good overview of persisting challenges for <br/>policy makers in the field of counter-terrorism. In the next video we will look into fear and resilience <br/>regarding terrorism. <br/><b> </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5_4></a><b>5.3 Fear and resilience <br/></b>  <br/>Hi there. In the previous video I mentioned a number of issues that need our attention and I singled <br/>out fear of terrorism resilience and. The management of fear, prior, during or after a terrorism <br/>related incident. And in this video, we will explore these issues. <br/>
Well, let me go back to the first week. And where we discuss the definition and essence of <br/>
terrorism. And although there is no generally accepted definition of the term, there is agreement <br/>that it is an instrument. An instrument used by certain actors to achieve certain goals. But the <br/>important part is that they try to Achieve these goals by spreading fear and anxiety through violent <br/>acts. And these violent acts are part of the tool, not the goal itself. <br/>
And I also quoted Brian Jenkins, who in the 1970s said, terrorists like to see a lot of people <br/>
watching, not a lot of people dead. Or in other words, it's the images and reactions that count. How <br/>you and I react to a bomb attack or a shooting spree, of course, also influenced by the media, <br/>statements by politicians, et cetera. After the attacks on the United States on the 11th September <br/>2001 there has been a drastic increase in investments in counter terrorism. Many intelligence <br/>organizations were given additional means and sometimes additional powers and legal tools to do <br/>their work. And there have been investments in other organizations as well actually any actor that <br/>somehow could contribute to prevent violent radicalization, extremism, terrorism, et cetera. <br/>
And we also saw a number of new actors, new agencies, counter-terrorism coordinators, <br/>
fusion centers. Well in the first five, six years after 9/11 many of these investments and measures <br/>were of a ad hoc nature including immediate reactions to incidents threats et cetera. And the <br/>emphasis was for good reasons on Preventing terrorist attacks and especially one of the scale of 9/11. <br/>Well, fortunately, Al Qaeda or other terrorist organizations did not manage to repeat an attack on <br/>that scale. And in fact, as we noted in the third week Of this course, the number of attacks in the <br/>West was relatively low. And although each attack is one too many, and each victim is one too many, <br/>it remained very low. Again, at least in the West. <br/>
Unfortunately, in other parts of the world, we did see an increase but not in the West. <br/>
However, the impact of terrorism on societies remained very high. Terrorism was high on the <br/>political agenda And according to public opinion polls a lot of people feared terrorism. Thus, in that <br/>sense, terrorists got what they wanted, a lot of people watching even if they didn't manage to kill a <br/>lot of people. again, at least in the West. <br/>
Well, this raises a fundamental question about the effectiveness of counter-terrorism <br/>
measure and the effectiveness of all these investments. Although difficult to prove, one might argue <br/>that the enormous investments seem to have contributed to prevent terrorist incidents, and that's <br/>good news. But terrorism is not only about killing, it's also about fear. So, the second part is the fear <br/>part, and there we did see that despite all this investment, there was still a very high level of fear and <br/>attention for terrorism. <br/>
Well, in week three, I gave the example from the Netherlands where one single terrorist <br/>
killed somebody else, Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh. And he caused very high levels of fear in the <br/>Netherlands. Although there has been a lot of investments in the Netherlands at the same time one <br/>person was able to make us very scared about terrorism. Well these high levels of fear are bad for at <br/>least two reasons. First it can lead to distress and stereotyping of certain groups in society. And it can <br/>cause preference for tough action oriented reactions to terrorism, and two simple explanations for <br/>this phenomenon. Which is the second reason why fear should be considered to have a bad impact <br/>on society. <br/>
Well, these immediate reactions and simple explanations for terrorism are often quite <br/>
automatic responses by policy makers, politicians and the general public. It's almost like a reflect a <br/>reflex. Though understandable it can lead to sub-optimal policies and policy making. and even worse <br/>it can lead to overreactions a by the public by politicians and policy makers. And that, in turn, can <br/>lead to polarization of society, radicalization. Well, you might end up in a negative spiral in which fear <br/>for terrorism leads to more terrorism and some terrorists are very aware of that and play into that. <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5_5></a>One of the most prominent academic critics of a counter terrorism approach that leads to <br/>
more fear and anxiety is the British sociologist Frank Furedi and he studied how western society finds <br/>it very difficult to deal with change and risk. And he has studied the reactions in the west in the <br/>United States in the United Kingdom to the events of 9/11. And he warns against what he calls a <br/>culture of fear. In his book Invitation to Terror he describes how it leads to fatalistic attitudes. <br/>Pessimism, vulnerability and fear of terrorism. And according to Furedi, such an attitude and such <br/>thinking produces a self-fulfilling prophecy an invitation to be terrorized and some terrorists know <br/>this. think for instance of the often used phrase, we love death more than you love life, which is <br/>aimed to scare a lot of us. <br/>
Well, unfortunately, also politicians and policy makers produce slogans that sometimes make <br/>
terrorists and terrorism bigger and scarier than it is. Slogans like the Global War on Terrorism or the <br/>Long War are not always very helpful. They sometimes betray confusion about the threat we face or <br/>the size of the threat we face, and according to Faraday it undermines our capacity to engage with it. <br/>And he says that it should be stress that the cultural fear entails a much more than just a fear of <br/>terrorism. It's part of a what others calls also have pointed at the emergence of a so called risk <br/>society which can actually better be translated as a risk avoidance society. it shows how the West in <br/>particular has become more vulnerable to accidents, disasters and violent incidents. <br/>
Against this background I would like to make a plea for a change of attitude towards  <br/>
terrorism. to limit its impact especially in countries that are not often hit by terrorism, in which <br/>terrorism is not a daily threat. Well one of the terms, one of the ideas that has been put forward in <br/>the debate on the impact of terrorism on politics and societies is the concept of resilience. Well, this <br/>particular concept find its roots in civil engineering psychology and ecology. And, in short, it indicates <br/>the capacity of materials, persons or biotopes to resist sudden change or stress. as well as the <br/>capacity to recover and to return to its previous state the situation as before. But from the <br/>perspective of counter terrorism resistance and resilience may be regard, may be regarded <br/>important capacities to deal with the negative impact of terrorism, the fear of terrorism by <br/>individuals and societies as a whole. And a resilient society in my eyes is more able to cope and to <br/>recover from a terrorist attack, and terrorists who attack a resilient society will find it more difficult <br/>to have an impact. And to achieve their goals. Our knowledge of the importance and role of <br/>resilience in relation to terrorism and counter-terrorism is limited, but fortunately, in recent years, <br/>there has been more research into this field. <br/>
And we've also seen a growing number of government reports that look into crisis <br/>
communication after specific terrorist attacks. Well, this shows that at least in a number of countries, <br/>the governments are aware of the negative implications of overreactions.  But unfortunately there <br/>are still too many cases of terrorism terrorist attacks where the authorities and other actors did not <br/>seem to pay much attention to fear management. In the past years, we have been confronted by a, a <br/>number of these examples of overreactions to terrorist attacks. think of the handling of the terrorist <br/>attack in Boston. The Boston Marathon bombing Many things went pretty well but in my eyes there <br/>was also an overreaction after the killing of three people and wounding of a lot of people by two <br/>perpetrators. And the same holds for the attack on the British soldier in Woolwich, London. I think in <br/>both cases the perpetrators got the attention they wanted and that in itself in my eyes is a good <br/>reason to do more to limit the impact of their deeds. <br/>
Well with that in mind, and given the indirect and long-term costs of fear of terrorism it <br/>
seems high time to focus. on communication and resilience as an integral part of our counter-<br/>terrorism policies. we not only limit need to limit the chance that terrorists will strike us but we also <br/>have to make sure that when they do, the impact of their deeds will be limited. <br/>
In sum, in this video we discussed the impact of fear of terrorism on societies, and we argued <br/>
why it is important to limit fear and to increase resilience to terrorism. In the next video, we'll look at <br/>fear impact management and ways to increase resilience of communities and societies. <br/> <br/> <br/><b> </b><br/>

<hr/>
<a name=5_6></a><b>5.4 Fear and impact management <br/> <br/></b>Hello, in the previous video, I made a plea for fear management as part of counter-terrorism policies. <br/>And I also mentioned the lack of knowledge in this field. Against this backdrop my colleague <br/>[UNKNOWN] and I looked into the still limited number of handbooks and strategies that focus on <br/>how to deal with fear. before, during and after a terrorist, terrorist attack or other terrorism related <br/>incident. Well, these documents are mainly from the United States, United Kingdom, the Netherlands. <br/>Also some interesting materials from Denmark. And they provide us with best practices in the <br/>following three domains. <br/>
First, best practices on the organization of fear management. How do you organize that? <br/>
What should governments do? Then the second category relates to communication, and the third <br/>category relates to resilience to terrorism. Regarding the organization of fear management, the key <br/>question is, how can governments and auto-relevant actors limit the impact of terrorism by reducing <br/>fear, anxiety, and intimidation? <br/>
One of the most obvious and most often mentioned conclusion is that they should cooperate <br/>
and coordinate. Very obvious conclusion, but again, very important. They have to cooperate and <br/>coordinate. also very important is the need to, know what the other ones are doing. have sets of <br/>protocols.  And also mentioned, is the need to practice together. Was specifically mentioned in <br/>several reports and studies, is the need to establish partnerships with the public and with the media. <br/>The government should engage with the media and also very specific group that requires partnership <br/>is representatives, spokespersons of ethnic, cultural or religious minorities. The idea is that they <br/>should work together with the government and the government with them to deal with public unrest <br/>and tensions, and to make sure that an increase in fear and anxiety is prevented. <br/>
Or finally, fear management should include the monitoring of reactions to government <br/>
measures, government performance. and ideally you do that at home, in your home country, but <br/>also abroad as many of the terrorist incidents have an international dimension. Regarding <br/>communication, the key challenge is determining the goals and content of communication. And we <br/>believe, having studied all these documents, that the starting point should be to listen to the public's <br/>concerns. While other valuable best practices and recommendations include the, to be honest to be <br/>frank and open and avoid being unnecessarily secretive. <br/>
Another set of recommendations is that you communicate with compassion with concern <br/>
and with empathy. Well, in case of an incident, the first hour is regarded a vital hour, the golden hour <br/>that can set the tone for the rest of the handling of the communication of the crisis. In this case, a <br/>terrorist incident. in the initial phase, it's very important to provide the public with facts. And also <br/>with advisory measures to the public. explain and clarify what's going on. And why certain measures <br/>and decisions have been taken. Confirm and deny rumors as quickly as possible. <br/>
Well, despite an incomplete picture, and in most cases of terrorism-related instances there is <br/>
an incomplete picture. It is important to come up with a clear and concise message of what is going <br/>on. one tone of voice is also very important. And even if there is not much to communicate you are <br/>advised to continue communicating with the public. No news is also news, and if you do not provide <br/>news. And if there is a lack of communication information, you give room to speculation by the <br/>media or by the public. <br/>
Well, the authorities are also advised to be aware of the risks of an over-reaction. They <br/>
should not play into the hands of terrorism. and you can do that by avoiding unnecessary rhetoric or <br/>alarmist words. And it's also very important that policy makers, officials, realize that there's also a <br/>message in the physical measures they are taking. think of helicopters in the air. special arrest teams <br/>on the street. it's not just a measure. There's also a message involved in that. And you have to be <br/>aware of that. Again, explain what's going on to the public. <br/>
And at the same time you have to monitor what's going on among the public. Of course, <br/>
through social media you can see how they react to what you are doing. Well and the overall goal of <br/>communication should be to limit. the impact of an incidence and the normalization of society. So, <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5_7></a>the idea is to go back to business as Soon as possible, back to normality as possible. But, of course, <br/>also, paying attention to aftercare and stress and emotions among the public. <br/>
One of the most important recommendations on resilience is providing self-efficacy. The <br/>
authorities should advise the public how they can be of help or how people can help themselves. <br/>People do not want to be mere victims or bystanders. They want to do something. They see <br/>something terrible, they want to do something. They want to be of help. For instance, by giving first <br/>aid or providing images to the police using their mobile phones. Or to join a demonstration in the <br/>days after an attack saying no to terrorism. And we've seen a number of examples of that in recent <br/>years. this could contribute to an increase of resilience and can further help to reduce the chance of <br/>excessive fear. Overreactions and tensions between different parts of society. And providing the <br/>general public with advising measures also holds for later stages of the crisis. <br/>
And that brings to me to a second set of recommendations and lessons learned. this relates <br/>
to care for the public. And authorities are advised not to only focus on the direct victims. the, the, <br/>the dead and wounded, but also on those who survived and who are possibly traumatized because of <br/>what they've seen and experienced. And the idea is that monitoring these indirect victims and taking <br/>care of these indirect victims is important. Also with an eye to prevent all kinds of second-order <br/>effects such as polarization, tension between groups, and the spread of fear and anxiety. And <br/>connected to this is, and mentioned earlier, that is that this can be limited by including <br/>representatives of various minorities, and, and other groups. To make agreements on their possible <br/>role, to deal with public unrest and possible tensions. <br/>
These lessons learned and recommendations can be of great value to limit the possibility that <br/>
terrorists get what they want. Seriously intimidating a population, and destabilizing a country. And <br/>there's, these are some of the main Goal of terrorists, I believe it's very important to incorporate. <br/>fear management, impact management into general counterterrorism policies. <br/>
Of course, next to the very important efforts to limit the chance of a terrorist attack as, as <br/>
much as possible. Well, fortunately, in recent year, increasing attention has been paid to the <br/>organization and com, and, and practice of communication, crisis communication as well as the <br/>increase of resilience to terrorism. And hopefully a growing number of authorities will realize that if it <br/>will, if we can make it more difficult for terrorists to have an impact on society. This instrument, this <br/>terrorism can become, in the long run, a less rewarding and less effective instrument than it is today. <br/>
So, what have we learned? In this video, we looked at lessons learned derived from <br/>
handbooks and strategies on fear management related to terrorism. And, we looked at the <br/>organizational fear management, communication, and resilience. And in the next video, we will <br/>explore the future of terrorism, terrorism policies, and terrorism research. <br/><b> </b><br/>

<a name=5_8></a><b>5.5 Future of terrorism <br/></b> <br/>Hi. In the previous video, we've looked at fear and fear management, in relation to terrorism. And in <br/>this video, we're going to explore the future of terrorism. What can we expect in the years to come? <br/>What type of terrorist groups, type of attacks, will we be confronted with, in let's say, five or ten <br/>years from now? Well of course I don't have a crystal ball, and it's impossible to predict the future. <br/>But we can look at root causes, trends, And developments, and develop scenarios that give us a little <br/>a little bit more insight into possible futures of terrorism. So what are we going to do? <br/>
First, we are going to look at past attempts at scenarios, and futures forecasts of terrorism. <br/>
And next we will see how we can build on these achievements of past attempts. And how we can add <br/>to this body of knowledge, by making use of your insights as a follow-up to the questionnaire that we <br/>provided in the first week of this course. <br/>
Considering the complexity of the phenomenon of terrorism, it's actually surprising to see <br/>
how many people have tried to look into its future. And the number of predictions or forecasts have <br/>increased dramatically, after 9/11. But unfortunately, so far, the general outcome of these studies is <br/>relativity poor. we see that a lot of scholars or experts find it very difficult to forecast changes in the <br/>modus operandi of terrorism. the changes in the use of tactics and weapons. And the attacks on 9/11 <br/>are a case in point. Well although the 9/11 Commission speaks of a shock and not a surprise. Here <br/>you have a copy of the report of the 9/11 Commission. it say, it says that there we apparent <br/>analytical failures on the part of those who were supposed to keep the United States safe from <br/>terrorism. And in their chapter Foresight and Hindsight they actually present what perhaps is the <br/>biggest failure, and that is the failure of imagination. They didn't see it coming. A failure of <br/>imagination. Well, when looking at publications on the future of terrorism by think tanks, academia, <br/>and government agencies it appeared after 9/11. <br/>
We see many different types of forecasts, with different intentions different methodologies, <br/>
if they have any meh, methodology, and different purposes. Well unfortunately, many studies are <br/>Rather vague, and very imprecise regarding their prediction. They're not very transparent. however, <br/>most arrive at three very obvious and not very specific general conclusions. And these three main <br/>conclusions are the following, again, some of them, or maybe all of them are very obvious. <br/>
The first one is, terrorism will continue to exist in the future. And the second one is, terrorism <br/>
is not static, but a changing phenomenon that is likely to change in the future. And then the third <br/>general conclusion looks into why it's still changing in the future. And it says that these changes will <br/>be influenced by structural factors, be it geo, geopolitical, demographical, technological or <br/>ideological. This raises the question, to what extent these studies actually contribute to more insight <br/>into what is yet to come. <br/>
Moreover the vagueness or lack of methodology, and the lack of a proper theoretical <br/>
foundation of these studies should be mentioned. as a result, the body of literature provides, actually, <br/>only limited insight about the causes of change, and what factors are deemed to be more important <br/>in shaping the future of terrorism, than others. But there are exceptions to the rule, and I would like <br/>to mention this book by Brynjar Lia, Globalization and the Future of Terrorism Patterns and <br/>Predictions. A great book about the future of terrorism, looking actually at these patterns and <br/>predictions. <br/>
Well, what I, I would also like to stress, is that most of the forecasts on terrorism, actually tell <br/>
us more about today's terrorism, than terrorism in the future. In fact in most cases, current trends <br/>and latest incidents, dominate the reports and studies. And this should not necessarily be considered <br/>negatively, as the future, or tomorrow is very often more or less the same as today. <br/>
However from time to time, we do know that terrorists manage to surprise us with new <br/>
types of attack, attacks or different types of groups, sometimes with means that we could hardly <br/>imagine. So therefore, we cannot afford to simply expect the future of terrorism to be more or less <br/>the same as today. at least if we want to avoid unpleasant surprises we cannot permit another failure <br/>of imagination a was, as was the case with 9/11. So, we need to be able to look beyond today, or at <br/>least to have some idea of what the future might bring. <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5_9></a>Well, in a report for the ICT and in a study for the Journal for Strategic Security. I noted, <br/>
noticed that most future forecasts are made by persons, mainly men, who deal with <br/>counterterrorism on a daily basis, who are mainly from Western countries. A, and among them are <br/>people who didn't see 9/11 coming, and who produce reports that are not very transparent, nor <br/>systematic in their approach in forecasting terrorism. Therefore I argued for a more systematic <br/>approachbusing fresh pair of eyes. <br/>
And I also suggested that we should ask a more geographically and gender-balanced group. <br/>
Including young, non-expert persons to help us to look into the future of terrorism. And we <br/>suggested to do so by way of a survey. Well, such an approach is not an Alternative to the existing <br/>body of literature on for future forecasts. But it could contribute to a more systematic and broader <br/>approach to look into the future of terrorism, and might also produce more imagination, more out-<br/>of-the-box thinking. <br/>
Well, as we have learned from the questionnaire's in the first four weeks, we know that this <br/>
group is capable of providing excellent ideas. And we believe that you could be actually of great help <br/>to policymakers and scholars and you can offer interesting ideas because of your global perspective. <br/>Because you have a fresh pair of eyes, or, and that holds for some of you, by a way of your <br/>experience in the field of security, that is not directly linked to terrorism. Well in order to use this <br/>unique potential of this community, we came up with a questionnaire on root causes and key <br/>developments, that might shape the future of terrorism. And we also want to ask you again, but now <br/>in more detail, about a possible fifth wave of terrorism again linked to the article by David Rappaport <br/>which we presented in the first week. Well please have a look at the questions, and you can do us a <br/>great favor if you would take the time to fill this out. Again, we really feel that this group has a great <br/>potential to provide both policy makers and scholars with new and different insights, into possible <br/>trends and developments that will determine the future of terrorism. That will determine also, future <br/>policy making and future research into terrorism. <br/>
To sum up, in this video we explored attempts to forecast the future of terrorism. And we <br/>
notice that many studies do not arrive at very specific outcomes, very specific conclusions. And partly <br/>as a result of this, from time to time, terrorists manage to surprise us. Therefore, we need to improve <br/>our forecast, and to that end, also, the questionnaire on the future of terrorism. In the next video I <br/>will look at the course objectives and say a few words about the research, the discussion forum, and I <br/>would like to thank all the people that made this course possible. <br/> <br/>
 <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5_10></a><b>6 Final video: Reflection on the course, the learning outcomes and looking forward <br/></b> <br/>Hello. This is the final video of the final week of this course on Terrorism and Counter Terrorism. <br/>Time to look back, time to look back also at the initial goals that we formulated. What we hoped to <br/>achieve with this goals of, with this course, and, and to also look back at what we achieved. So what <br/>were the goals that we hope to achieve? Well we hope that you would learn about the following. The <br/>notion of terrorism, as an instrument to achieve certain political goals. And also the difficulties and <br/>importance of definitions of terrorism. And we hope to tell you more and to give you a better idea, of <br/>the state of the art of terrorism and counter terrorism studies, in particular, its results of the last ten <br/>years. <br/>
Also very important to us is to confront you, and to teach you more about theoretical notions, <br/>
as well as practical examples, that help you to better understand and critique counter terrorism, <br/>policies or approaches to counter terrorism. And the same holds for theoretical notions, as well as <br/>practical examples, that will help you to better understand the essence of terrorism. What is it about, <br/>and what can we do about it? <br/>
Well of course, it's not up to me to decide, to what extent we have achieved these goals. but <br/>
you could help us and you can tell us, what you think about this course, by way of the evaluation, <br/>which we will send to you by mail or you can use the feedback forum. What else is there to do in the <br/>last video, after five weeks of learn, of this learning and research experience? Well, perhaps you, to <br/>tell you what I learned from this course. <br/>
Well to me, it was a very interesting experience. I learned a lot from the differences of <br/>
opinion between the Courserians, as well as difference of opinion between you and me. We don't <br/>always share the same ideas, and I realize that I have a, Western way of looking at terrorism and <br/>counter terrorism. I also learned a lot from the discussion forum. and I was very much surprised that, <br/>although terrorism and counter terrorism are very subjective and sensitive topics, that we managed <br/>to to have a very polite, respectful discussion, at a high level. and that was perhaps, one of the <br/>biggest surprises to me. <br/>
I also learned that a very international mixed group of people including students experts in <br/>
the field of security studies and, and many others with an interest in terrorism, can come up with, <br/>with great ideas. can share literature tips regarding movies, provide a lot of information on, on many <br/>different subjects. For instance, and I like to use this course to that end, to provide us with out of the <br/>box thinking, new ideas about the future of terrorism, for instance. So, that was a great experience <br/>and, and I learned a lot from it. <br/>
I was also impressed by the many people who responded to the questionnaires, and you <br/>
provided us with many insights, and, and many data. in fact, we soon realized that all the, the <br/>materials, the amount and the quality, that we, we, we got from the questionnaires and, and the <br/>questions, and the, the discussion forum, was too much for us to analyze very quickly, and <br/>immediately present. So for us, the course has not ended, we will have to do a lot of work in <br/>analyzing all this data, all this insight you gave us. And we will translate it into briefs, publications, <br/>that we will post on the course dashboard, which will remain open for another few weeks. And we <br/>will use a a LinkedIn group called Leiden University online course Terrorism and Counter terrorism to <br/>make sure that all the briefs or papers, or whatever we produce, will be available to you. So it's the <br/>LinkedIn group Leiden University online course, Terrorism and Counter-terrorism. so we learned a lot, <br/>and, and, we'll even learn more, thanks to your research input. <br/>
And this is the reason, why we like, would like to offer this course a second time. So we will <br/>
have a relaunch. Initially we thought of mid-December, but I guess that the holidays is not the best <br/>time to start any course, and particularly not one on, political violence. so we decided to start in <br/>January, a new year, 2014. A new chance for those who have not done this course so far, to start this <br/>course on terrorism and counter-terrorism. You would do us a great favor, if you would inform <br/>friends, colleagues about this course, of course, only if you liked it. there is a chance for them as well, <br/>to start this course early January 2014. The 6th of January, to be precise. Well a second launch means <br/>that obviously I like to develop and present this course. Although I have to stress that, it was a lot <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5_11></a>more, a lot bigger effort, and much more investment, than I initially thought. But, I liked to do it <br/>because of your reactions, your input. <br/>
Again, the questionnaires, the discussion forum, the course wiki. and  many of you I have to <br/>
thank. but I will say a special thanks to our top dozen posters, that contributed to the discussion <br/>forum. And these are Jenny Glynn from the UK, Valeria Hernandez Reyes from Mexico, Claire van <br/>Beers [FOREIGN] Charles Cameron and Bob Boss from the United States. Amjad Hussein from <br/>Pakistan, Arete from the UK, and Gary John Davis from Canada. Ernst Schnell and Stewart from the <br/>United Kingdom, and Anna from the United States, and Deepa from India. Thank you very much and <br/>thank you, all who contributed to the Discussion Forum, or who added something to the course wiki. <br/>
While I also liked providing this course because of the great people who helped me making <br/>
this possible, and whose help was actually essential, to the success of this course. a big thank you to <br/>[FOREIGN] the course or project manager, well, responsible for virtually everything. So, thank you <br/>very much Jeanine, you're actually recording this, as we speak. And I would also like to thank Thomas <br/>Hershkins, who did most of the recording, most of the filming. Thank you very much for your <br/>patience also, not only while filming this but, also having to look at my face, and hearing me talk for <br/>hours on end, while doing the editing, which was also a lot of work. So, thank you very much for that. <br/>
Also, a big thank you to two persons, [FOREIGN] from the Center of Innovation of Leiden <br/>
University, who made this course possible, behind the set, in the boardrooms of this university. <br/>Whose rector, and particularly, Vice Rector Simone [FOREIGN]. Strongly supported this investment in <br/>innovation, in research and education. So thank you very much. And there're many other people at <br/>Leiden University that I, I would like to thank. Many people contributed, ranging from well, the <br/>neighbors, actually here. The, the neighbors of the, the offices who had to remain silent on many <br/>recording days they were very patient. They were not always silent, but they tried at least, so thank <br/>you very much for your patience. and, and other people ranging from interns to educational experts, <br/>that one way or another, contributed to the success of this course. <br/>
And then finally very important, I would Like to thank the team that did an excellent job to <br/>
make the interactive element of this course, such a big success, the discussion forum. thank you very <br/>much [FOREIGN] for leading a enthusiastic team of community monitor, moderators. Rianne, Einat, <br/>Danny, Nicolas, Borat and Masuma, thank you for also working in weekends, monitoring what's going <br/>on and making the discussion forum such a success. And then finally, allow me to repeat, thanking <br/>you for participating in this course. I hope you enjoyed this course, and it was a pleasure to work with <br/>you. Although most of you I haven't seen, but again, thank you very much for participating. <br/> <br/>

<a name=6_1></a><b>6.1 WHY IS IT MAKING HEADLINES? <br/></b> <br/>Hi  there.  This  is  week  six  of  the  course,  Terrorism  and  Counterterrorism,  Comparing  Theory  and <br/>Practice. And in this week, we're going to discuss the issue of foreign fighters. Well actually last week <br/>we discussed how  to deal with terrorism, the  impact of terrorism, and terrorism related incidents. <br/>We looked into under-researched topics and the future of terrorism. And in previous runs, in the first <br/>two runs of this course that was the end of the course. But, in light of developments in Syria and Iraq, <br/>and given the global impact of the phenomena foreign fighters, we decided to add this video to the <br/>course because it's highly topical and I think it's, it deserves to be part of this course on terrorism. <br/>This is the number issue on many agendas around  the world. So what are we going to discuss this <br/>week?  We  going  to  look  into  the  question,  why  is  it  making  headlines  today?  What's  so  relevant? <br/>What's  so  important  about  this  phenomenon  of  foreign  fighters?  Then  we  look  into  the  foreign <br/>fighters  in  Syria.  Questions  like,  why  do  they  go?  What  are  they  doing  out  there?  And  then  third, <br/>we're going to look into different foreign fighting groups in Syria that are active there. Some are also <br/>active  in Iraq, like Islamic State. And we look  at  foreign fighters as a  threat. Do they pose  a threat <br/>over  there  or  in  the  countries  of origin.  And  then  finally  we  look  into  policy  options.  What can  be <br/>done about this phenomenon, and we will use the UN counterterrorism strategy as a guideline. Why <br/>is it making headlines today?  <br/> <br/>Well it's very much related to the Syrian Uprising. A number of demonstrations in 2011 and in 2012 <br/>that turned into a civil war. Between on the one hand the regime of Assad and many opponents who <br/>want  to  get  rid  of  that  regime.  But  also  many  from  outside  Syria  join  to  fight.  So  called  foreign <br/>fighters. And according to a report by the Soufan Group in June 2014, no less than 12,000 fighters <br/>from  81  countries  joined  that  civil  conflict.  And  according  to  Gilles  de  Kerchove,  the  Counter <br/>Terrorism  Coordinator  of  the  European  Union  in,  September  2014  there  are  no  less  than  3000 <br/>Europeans,  E.U.  citizens  or  residents  that  are  also  fighting  in  the  conflict  in  Syria.  So  it’s  making <br/>headlines  because  of  this  international  nature.  But  especially  because  of  the  fact  that  it's  a  very <br/>bloody civil war causing a lot of casualties, people being killed refugees, etc. Add to that the fear that <br/>some of these foreign fighters might return to their countries of origin and also start causing trouble <br/>out there. What do we know about these people and why they go? So what about research into this <br/>phenomenon of foreign fighters? <br/> <br/>Well first, how to define it. I like the definition by Malet who defines foreign fighters as non-citizens <br/>of conflict states who join insurgencies during civil conflicts. Basically it's people that are not part of <br/>that country, that go to another country to join the fight over there. And this phenomena is not new <br/>at all. Let me focus on Europeans but also others that joined a foreign fight in the past. Think of the <br/>Spanish  Civil  War.  Many  people  from  around  the  world.  Here  you  see  a  picture  of  Hemingway, <br/>famous American writer was also part in that civil war. They joined either the conservative  Franco <br/>side  or  the  leftist  side  with  the  International  Brigades.  Another example  from  the  1930s,  this  took <br/>place  in  1930s, was  the  invasion of  Finland  by the  Soviet  Union,  1938, the  Winter  War.  Big  nation <br/>versus  small  Finland,  nobody,  no  other  country  went  to  the  aid  of  Finland.  But  thousands  of <br/>volunteers  did,  mainly  from  Scandinavian  countries,  Sweden,  Denmark,  Norway,  but  also  from <br/>Britain, Germany, Hungary, and other states. And then more recent examples, Afghanistan also after <br/>the  invasion  of  the  Soviet  Union  1979,  a  lot  of  people  came  to  the  aid  of  the  Afghans  as  Muslim <br/>fighters that wanted to defend the unmapping attack by the Soviet Union. And also another example <br/>from the past is Bosnia. In the early 1990s where a lot of people came to the aid of the Bosnians and <br/>the  Bosnian government. But  what do we know  about  this  phenomenon? What  do we know  from <br/>research?  If  I  have  to  recommend  one  general  study  about  foreign  fighters  it's  the  book  by  David <br/>Malet.  Here  you  see  the  cover,  foreign  fighters'  transnational  identity  in  civil  conflicts.  And  he <br/>collected  data  on  foreign  fighters.  And  looked  into  civil  conflicts  between  1815  and  2005,  and  he <br/>discovered in the 331 cases there were at least 70 of them featuring foreign fighters. But in general, <br/>there's surprisingly few studies. So it's not a new phenomenon, it's, it's, it's happening in 70 out of <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6_2></a>330 cases, but very little studies. And most studies are case studies about countries, and single cases, <br/>mainly descriptive about numbers and trends. But no general explanations. And again, the exception <br/>to  the  rule  is  the  book  by  Malet.  There  are  more  exceptions.  A  study  by  Mustapha  about  the <br/>Mujahideen  in  Bosnia.  Foreign  fighters  as  cosmopolitan  citizens  and,  or  terrorists.  And  a  book  by <br/>Mark  Sageman.  Understanding  Terror  Networks,  that  partly  looped  into,  foreign  fighters  in,  or, <br/>Afghanistan.  <br/> <br/>We know very little on the individual level. Why did a person, what what's the motivation of persons <br/>to go there? The individual motivation. Little about return or reintegration. We know that thousands <br/>in the past have gone to places to fight, foreign fighters. Some have died, but many have returned. <br/>But  how?  And,  and  what  have  they  done  after,  after  their  returned?  There's  also  little  on  the <br/>organizational  aspects  and  obstacles.  People might  want  to  join  a  group,  but  do  they manage  and <br/>how does that work? Are they accepted or not? And we also know very little about why some person <br/>might have had the idea or even expressed the idea that I'm going to join the fight, but in the end for <br/>certain reasons, did not go. Some conclusions on the yet relatively limited body of knowledge on this <br/>subject.  Well  the  conclusions  so  far  are  not  very  surprising.  They  go  for  ideological  or  religious <br/>reasons or political religious reasons. It's often organized or part of a larger movement, transnational <br/>movement. And they're mainly young and mainly male. And most historical cases are cases in which <br/>government actors or governments directly or indirectly sponsored it.  <br/> <br/>Well, after 2012, you could say the situation has improved. There's a lot more interest in the study of <br/>foreign fighters. And we see a sudden increase in publications, reports, etc., mainly by governmental <br/>agencies,  think  tank,  and  consultants,  and  relatively  few  scholars,  yet.  And  also  these  studies, <br/>especially from the West, are alarmist in nature. They focus on the potential threat to the countries <br/>of origin. And they're  very policy oriented, focusing on prevention, the return and reintegration of <br/>foreign fighters. And they have less interest or there's less attention for the impact on the ground in <br/>Syria Iraq, and elsewhere. To what extent do these foreign fighters contribute to the atrocities? Are <br/>they a fighting force to be reckoned with or are they just cannon fodder or nuisance to these groups? <br/>Or  are  they  important  mainly  for  propaganda  reasons?  And  also  an  important  question  are  they <br/>accepted  by  the  local  population  or  not?  Well  we  can  explain  the  boom  of  course  very,  because <br/>there's money available, there's these pressing questions that the governments face. And they have <br/>provided funds to do research. Maybe more importantly, more important is that it's relatively open <br/>debate. The terrorism label has not always been used. It's not always a criminal offense to support <br/>foreign fighting groups. In most countries it is, but not in all countries. And many actors are involved. <br/>You can study this phenomenon from many different angles. From the impact that this phenomenon <br/>has on inter and intrafaith relate, relations, the role of parents in communities, to the international <br/>dimension. The military and diplomatic dimension. <br/> <br/>And finally, very important, there's the possibility to have access to key players. The foreign fighters <br/>themselves. We discovered, with my team that it's actually surprising how many of them want to talk <br/>to you. Or people that have the intention to go want to talk to you. Either directly or by way of social <br/>media.  To  sum  up,  foreign  fighters  are  not  a  new  phenomenon,  but  it's  been  surprisingly  under-<br/>researched,  at  least  until  recently.  There  has  been  a  boom  after  2012  because  of  the  situation  in <br/>Syria.  And  it's  actually  quite  surprising  how  many  opportunities  there  are  to  study  today's  foreign <br/>fighters. In the next video, we'll look into foreign fighters in Syria. Who are these people? And why <br/>did they go to join the fight in Syria?  <br/> <br/><b>6.2 FOREIGN FIGHTERS IN SYRIA – WHO ARE THEY AND WHY DO THEY GO? <br/> <br/></b>Hi  there.  In  a  previous  video,  we  discussed  why  the  phenomenon  of  foreign  fighters  is  making <br/>headlines, and we looked into the historical context, discovering that the phenomenon is actually not <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6_3></a>very new. In this video, we want to look into the phenomenon of foreign fighters in Syria. Who are <br/>these people? Why did they go there? What are they doing out there?  <br/> <br/>According  to  a  number  of  reports,  their  number  is  more  than  10,000.  The  Soufan  Group  in  2014 <br/>spoke of 12,000 foreign fighters. Well, I'm not sure about these numbers. They're, they're estimates. <br/>And many say that in the summer of 2014 and the fall of 2014, these numbers have gone up. Well, <br/>here you have some other figures. 60 to 70% are believed to be from the Middle East, many from <br/>neighboring  or  nearby  countries.  And  20  to  25%  are  from  Europe,  other  Western  countries,  and <br/>Russia.  Well,  Peter  Neumann  of  the  International,  of  the  International  Center  for  the  Study  of <br/>Radicalization in London in September 2014, talked about 3,000 people from Tunisia. That's the, the <br/>country  that  provides  most,  or  provides,  or  where  most  foreign  fighters  are  from.  And  then  about <br/>between 1,200 to 2,500 are  from Saudi Arabia, 1,500 from Morocco, 1,500 from Jordan. And then <br/>700  from  France,  500  from  Britain,  400  from  Germany.  Well,  you  can  read  it  yourself.  300  from <br/>Belgium, 130 from the Netherlands, and about 100 from the United States. Well, add to that dozens <br/>from  Australia,  also  countries  like  Philippines  and  Indonesia,  making  it  a  really  worldwide <br/>phenomenon. And perhaps as many as 800 from Russia, mainly from the Caucasus region, Chechnya, <br/>and more than 100, 150 from Scandinavian countries. Well, allow me to focus on, mainly on those <br/>that are from my part of the world, the European Union.  <br/> <br/>We've done research into this phenomenon, so I can say a little bit more about these people than <br/>about foreign fighters in general. Well, what do we know? Well, they're mostly nationals from the EU <br/>countries,  few  residents,  few  refugees,  but  mostly  nationals  that  are  born  and  raised  in  these <br/>countries.  So  these  are  Britons,  French,  Danes.  They  are  from  these  countries,  born  and  raised  in <br/>these  countries.  Many  ethnic  backgrounds.  Many  from  Morocco,  Turkish  background,  Algerian <br/>background, and also relatively many converts. Some statistics speak as, speak in in, from Germany <br/>speak of 14%. If I look into the numbers in my own country that seems like a similar number. So one <br/>out  of  seven,  maybe  even  more,  are  converts.  They're  mainly  young  men,  but  also  women,  a  few <br/>older men, older persons, and according to Peter Norman again, ten of 20%percent of those who go <br/>to  Syria  are  women.  Why  do  they  go?  Why  do  people  that  were  born  and  raised  in  European <br/>countries  go  to  Syria?  Well,  one  way  to  study  it  is  by  making  a  distinction  between  push  and  pull <br/>factors.  Well,  pull  factors  are  factors  that  make  Sy,  that,  that  explain  why  Syria's  attracting  these <br/>people,  and  the  push  factors  are  factors  that  might  explain  why  people  want  to  leave  Europe  for <br/>Syria. Let's first look at the pull factors. There are many different categories.  <br/> <br/>The  first  category  is  doing  something  good,  a  purpose  in  life,  feeling  responsible  to  protect  poor <br/>people  that  have,  are  being  attacked  by  the  Assad  regime,  children,  women,  etc.  And  many  claim <br/>they  are  going  there,  especially  when they're  returning,  the  authorities  ask  them,  you  know,  what <br/>have you done there? Their answer is I went there to help people. Humanitarian aid. Well, some do. <br/>But we know that many of them are involved in the fighting. It's also being used as an excuse, as was <br/>used in, in the case of Afghanistan in the past. But many fight for what they believe is right to help <br/>people.  <br/> <br/>That  brings  me  to  a  second  category,  the  religious  motivation.  Some  do  so  and  they  just  don't <br/>mention women and children, but they, they say I do this to protect and it's my duty. From a religious <br/>perspective, my duty to protect the Ummah, the community of believers, the women and children <br/>and others in Syria. Add to that the idea to be part of the establishment of an ideal state based on <br/>religion,  under  Sharia  law  that  is  linked  to  the  concept  of  a  caliphate,  a  new  Islamic,  large  Islamic <br/>state for all Muslims that covers the entire Muslim world. Also, a religious motivation is to be part of <br/>a  radical  change  in  the  Middle  East.  The  prophecy  that  now  it's  the  end  of  the  old  times  and  the <br/>beginning  of  something  new,  an  ideal  new  world  under  the  black  banner  as  used  by  groups  like <br/>Islamic State. So the prophesy is also a pull factor. <br/> <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6_4></a>Then a third category of factors of reasons why  people are attracted to join the  fight  in Syria, and <br/>that's comradeship, group processes. And in week two, we  discussed that, the  social psychological <br/>approach,  and  we  refer  to  an  article  by  Max   Abrahms  What  Terrorists  Really  Want.  And  he <br/>discovered that this comradeship is very important as well. Well, we also see that in the case of Syria <br/>and those that go to Syria. And then the violence, thrill and adventure as such is also a pull factor. <br/>Some people want to experience something exciting, and they even go there because of the killing.  <br/> <br/>And then a final explanation of pull factor is the possibility, if you believe in this, to, to go to paradise, <br/>to die as a martyr. Well, then the push factors. We came across a number of these push factors while <br/>doing  research  on  Dutch  cases,  of  people  who  went  to  Syria,  together  with  my  colleague  Daan <br/>Weggemans  and  Peter  Grol.  It's  recommended  reading.  I  suggest  that  you  read,  it  gives you  some <br/>concrete  examples  of  life  stories  of  those  people  that  went  to  Syria.  And  while  studying  this,  we <br/>discovered  that  many  had  personal  problems,  failures  in  life,  traumatic  experiences,  as  well  as <br/>trouble with the authorities, trouble at school. And from literature, we know that also socioeconomic <br/>and sociopolitical situations or sociopolitical climate has to be mentioned as a possible explanation <br/>why people leave European countries. They don't feel at home, don't see any opportunity there, feel <br/>discriminated,  marginalized.  That  might  be  another  push  factor  why  people  go  to  Syria.  In  our <br/>research, we found little evidence of that, and apparently we need to do much more research into <br/>these factors that might help us explain why people go to places like Syria. To sum up, in this video, <br/>we looked into the phenomenon of foreign fighters in Syria, and we saw that they're from different <br/>countries and that there's no archetype foreign fighter. They have different backgrounds and they go <br/>there for different motivations. In the next video, we'll look into the different groups that are active <br/>in Syria.  <br/> <br/><b>6.3 FIGHTING GROUPS IN SYRIA <br/> <br/></b>Hi. In the previous video, we discussed the phenomenon of foreign fighters in Syria. Who are these <br/>people  and  why  did  they  go?  And,  in  this  video,  we'll  look  into  the  groups  that  these  people  join. <br/>Well,  there  are  many  different  groups,  and  that's,  that's  together,  have  a  fighting  force  of  maybe <br/>around  100,000,  different  estimates,  somewhere  between  75,000  and  115,000  rebels.  So  these <br/>people  that  fight  against  the  regime  of  Assad.  And  of  these  fighters,  about  12,000  are  foreign <br/>fighters, probably more. So where did these foreign fighters go to? What groups did they join? <br/> <br/>The three most noteworthy are the Free Syrian Army, Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic State, also known <br/>as Islamic State in Iraq and Syria or Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham. The Free Syrian Army. It was <br/>founded in 2011 by officers and soldiers that defected from the army of the regime of Assad. It has a <br/>secular outlook and it has a lot of international support. Some governments have said that Assad is <br/>not the representative of Syria anymore and said the opposition is the legitimate representative and <br/>the  Free  Syrian  Army  is  its  army,  is  its  military  wing.  And,  again,  it  has  support  from  a  number  of <br/>countries, not all countries, not Russia, not China. But from another, a number of countries. And our <br/>goal is, like all the other opposition groups, to bring down the regime. And its members are mostly <br/>Sunni  Arabs  but  also  it  has  a  lot  of  other  groups.  A lot  of  other  ethnic  and  a  lot  of  other  religious <br/>groups among its ranks. The problem is it has been badly organized and badly supplied. There's a lot <br/>of internal division and therefore it's never been a very effective fighting force. That's the reason why <br/>it lost a lot of support. Many defected to Islamist or Jihadist groups like Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic <br/>State. Jabhat al-Nusra. Also known under the name the Support Front for the People of Sham. Sham <br/>being the name for Syria. So the Support Front for the People of Syria. And it was founded in 2012. <br/>It's linked to al-Qaeda. It's recognized by al-Qaeda central, so al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, Pakistan, as a <br/>local affiliate of al-Qaeda. And it's got an al-Qaeda-ist agenda. It's also fighting the Assad regime, but <br/>more on religious ideological grounds. And its goal is not only to topple the regime, but also to create <br/>an Islamic state in Syria and a caliphate in the Levant. The Levant meaning that now is comprised of <br/>the  territories  of  Syria,  partly  Turkey,  small  part,  Lebanon,  Jordan,  Israel,  and  the  Palestinian <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6_5></a>territories. It's been designated a terrorist organization by a number of countries, among them the <br/>United  States,  but,  more  importantly,  it's  on  the  UN  list  of  terrorist  organizations.  Its  tactics  and <br/>modus  operandi  include  suicide  bombing  and  it  has  clashed  in  the  past  with  many  other  groups, <br/>including,  the  Free  Syrian  Army  and  Islamic  State.  Among  its  ranks  are  many  Syrians  but  it  also <br/>attracted  a  large  number  of  foreign  fighters,  include,  including  foreign  fighters  from  Europe. <br/>Hundreds of them went  to Jabhat  al-Nusra, but  also, recently,  hundreds defected to other  groups, <br/>mainly Islamic State, including the foreign fighters. Islamic State, also known as Islamic State in Iraq <br/>and al-Sham, al-Sham being the name for Syria. And so it's Islamic State, of Iraq and Syria, currently <br/>under the name Islamic State. Okay, what is Islamic State? <br/> <br/>That's a, a difficult question to answer. It's an insurgent group, it's a rebel group, it's a terrorist group. <br/>It's on the UN list of designated terrorist organizations. But it's much more. In many ways, it is also a <br/>state, controlling large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, which they conquered in, the summer of <br/>2014. It runs bakeries, schools, hospitals, organizes public, facilities. So it's got many different faces. <br/>It is composed of foreign fighters, many of them joined, Islamic State, but also local Iraqi, sometimes <br/>Syrian, tribes, rebels that, resist the central government either in Damascus or in Baghdad. So it's, it's <br/>a network of organizations with dif-,. sometimes different agendas, all under the same name, Islamic <br/>State.  And  if  we  add  to  that,  for  instance,  their  outreach  through  propaganda,  which  is  very <br/>professional, you could even say it's got  supporters  globally from Australia to the Netherlands and <br/>from Morocco to Chechnya. And, in that sense, it's almost also a social movement. So it's got many <br/>different features, many different ways you could define it. It makes it very difficult to actually say <br/>what  is  IS.  But  I,  this,  this,  this  confusion  is  perhaps  part  of  it.  IS,  very  difficult  to  describe.  Much <br/>clearer is, to describe its leader. It's, it's Abu Bakar al-Bagdadi, who managed to merge several groups <br/>into  this,  militant  group.  And  he  tried  to  merge  this  group  even  with  Jabhat  al-Nusra,  which  we <br/>discussed earlier, in 2013. But that was rejected by Jabhat al-Nusra, but also by al-Qaeda itself. So the <br/>al-Qaeda leadership, Al Zawahiri, rejected IS as an al-Qaeda affiliate. Its goal is to establish an Islamic <br/>caliphate, which it, which it did in June 2014 and its goal is not only fighting the Assad regime, but <br/>also  that  in  Baghdad,  and  also  fighting  other  opposition  forces.  And  the  opponents  are  almost <br/>everybody who disagrees with them.  <br/> <br/>Well, after conquering many of the territories they, that are under IS control, now we've seen lots of <br/>atrocities.  Lots  of  killings,  beheadings  of  local  groups,  of  American  journalists,  aid  workers,  many <br/>different people. So it's well known for its brutality. it's, at the same time, a very effective fighting <br/>force, fighting Kurds, other groups, and conquering more lands. So it's a, it's a huge challenge. It's, for <br/>instance, a challenge to al-Qaeda, who is the number one Islamist Jihadist movement or organization <br/>in  the  world.  Many  would  say  it's  not  al-Qaeda  anymore,  it's  IS.  And,  of  course,  it's  an  enormous <br/>challenge  to  the  countries  in  the  region,  to  neighboring  countries,  and  to  countries  that  support <br/>these countries like the United States. And these countries, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United, United <br/>Arab Emirates, et cetera, together with the United States, European countries, Australia have formed <br/>a coalition that is actually now fighting IS from the air since September 2014. What are these people <br/>doing out there? Those who joined Jabhat al-Nusra, Islamic State, or Free Syria Army and the many <br/>other groups. Well, here's a list of relevant activities. One is being bored and waiting. Warfare is not <br/>24/7 at the front, so many are bored and waiting for what's happening. Many have, been involved in <br/>training, sometimes basic training, sometimes more sophistic training, and they're involved in guard <br/>duties and help behind the front lines. And, of course, there's the fighting. Fighting with sniper rifles, <br/>all  kinds  of  weapons,  heavy  weapons,  Kalashnikovs,  anti-tank  rockets,  et  cetera,  et  cetera.  And, <br/>unfortunately, there's also many that are involved in war crimes. And some even go as far as to be <br/>part of suicide attacks. Well, that's the warfare part.  <br/> <br/>Propaganda's  also  very  important.  Many  of  them  are  very  active  on  social  media  trying  to  recruit <br/>others or to, make sure that people donate money for the fighting. So propaganda is an important <br/>element as well. And, of course, back home when they, are questioned by the authorities, they say, I <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6_6></a>went there to provide humanitarian assistance, and it should be stressed that some do, but many do <br/>so  next  to  the  fighting.  To  sum  up,  we  looked  at  three  groups  that  have  attracted  many  foreign <br/>fighters, from Europe and other places. The Free Syrian Army, Jabhat al-Nusra, and Islamic State. And <br/>we have seen that they have different agendas and some are more radicals than others. We've seen <br/>that  many  foreign  fighters  went  from,  one  organization  to  the  other  and  ended  up  in  the  more <br/>radical  ones,  Jabhat  al-Nusra  and  especially  Islamic  State.  These  more  radical  or  extremist <br/>organizations have a wider agenda, not only to topple the regime, but also go for other, have other <br/>goals as well. To establish an Islamic state or even a caliphate in the region or beyond the region. In <br/>the next video, we will look at foreign fighters as a threat. Are they a threat, yes or no, and to whom? <br/> <br/><b>6.4 FOREIGN FIGHTERS – A THREAT <br/> <br/></b>Hi there. In a previous video we looked at what foreign fighters are doing out there in Syria and what <br/>groups they join. And in this video we  would like to look  at the threat they pose. Or the potential <br/>threat  they pose  to the countries  of origin to Syria and Iraq, and other places. Well, these are  the <br/>questions we would like to address. What is the actual and potential threat posed by foreign fighters, <br/>and how do they pose a threat and to whom? And the focus is on Europe because we got relatively a <br/>lot  of  information  about  threat  assessments  in  Europe.  And  we  got  a  little  bit  more  information <br/>about  how  and  why  they  could  pose  a  threat  in  countries  within  the  EU.  Well,  the  idea  that  they <br/>might pose a threat was made public early 2013, when a number of European Intelligence Security <br/>Services.  Publicly  sounding  the  alarm  bell  over  the  increase  in,  in  numbers  of  people  from  Europe <br/>that went to join the fight in Syria. <br/> <br/>Here are a number of quotes of people that expressed their concern. Let me start with the report by <br/>Europol,  the  Terrorism  Situation  and  Trends  Report  2014.  In this  report,  returning  fighters,  it  says, <br/>have  the  potential  to  utilize  their  training,  combat  experience,  knowledge  and  contacts  to  for <br/>terrorist activities inside the EU. And Germany's Minister of the Interior feared that Syrian. Jihadist <br/>veterans returning to Europe after being trained in what he called deadly handwork will be, again a <br/>quote, ticking time bombs. While these are very worrisome expressions. By, especially the administer <br/>of the interior of Germany, but also Europol director Rob Wainwright. Said returning fighters could <br/>incite  others  to  join  the  armed  struggle.  Or  use  their  training,  combat  experience,  knowledge  and <br/>contacts to conduct violent activities within the borders of the EU. But it's not only European leaders <br/>of  police  organizations,  intelligence  organization,  that  express  concern.  What  about  the  worries  of <br/>those responsible for security in countries of origin outside Europe? <br/> <br/>Let's take the case of Tunisia. They got 3,000 foreign fighters that are active in Syria and Iraq. It's the <br/>largest contingent actually, and relatively small Tunisia has as many foreign fighters as there are from <br/>the European Union. And that country worried as expressed by the Tunisian interior minister, who in <br/>February  2014 said the  following. We said, we have managed to prevent nearly 8000 people from <br/>going  to  Syria.  And  we  don't  have  exact  numbers  for  those  who  have  returned  but  they  are <br/>estimated to number around 400. So, a relatively large group. And he's worried about, and expresses <br/>it in the following way. He says, we're following them very closely. We have built up a database. And <br/>they  have  a  quiet  experience  in  training  and  must  be  monitored.  So,  worries  also  in  countries  like <br/>Tunisia, and neighboring countries of Syria and, and Iraq, from which many countries have left to, to <br/>join  the  fight.  Why  is  this  the  case?  Well,  most  of  them  have  joined  jihadist  groups,  related  to  or <br/>inspired by al-Qaeda. And their agenda is more than just trying to assist local groups to topple the <br/>regime of Assad. Some, and, and actually, many of these group have a wider agenda, they want to <br/>establish  an  Islamic  state.  One  who's  borders  are  not  the  borders  of  Syria,  but  a  larger  area.  A <br/>Caliphate,  which  might  include  also  ideally,  Jordan  and  many  other  parts  of  the  Islamic  world.  So <br/>especially, for the countries in the region this is very worrisome. But some of these groups have, have <br/>a wider agenda in the sense that they also want to punish or attack powers that support what they <br/>call,  Infidel  or  corrupt  regimes,  including  countries  like  the  United  States.  And  many  also  have  on <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6_7></a>their list Israel as an enemy that has to be defeated. So, there are many countries that are worried <br/>about what's going on in Syria. <br/> <br/>If you look beyond the agenda of the jihadist groups and focus on the individual level. The worries of <br/>governments of the countries of origin pertain to the following issues. And as we mentioned already <br/>by  some  of  those  that  I've  quoted.  And  that's  the  further  radicalization.  Combat  training  and <br/>experience them being part of an International Jihadi Networks. So, some of them go as individuals, <br/>but  they  come  back  as  part  of  a  larger  network  and  some  countries  fear  that  they  are  being  sent <br/>home to stage an attack. Also, it's been mentioned very often that, they might have a very important <br/>role in propaganda and recruitment of new people going out there to fight. [SOUND] And then it's <br/>more of a second order of effect or an indirect effect. It has been mentioned that governments are <br/>worried about potential problems related to possible high number of traumatized returnees. Many <br/>of these people have gone to Syria unprepared. Have seen horrible things. Have maybe participated <br/>in  horrible  things.  Or  were  bystanders.  And  they  might  be  fall  victim  to  post  traumatic  stress <br/>syndrome.  That  could  lead  to  all  kinds  of  violence,  depression,  suicide.  and,  and  other  worrisome <br/>developments that might occur only later on. Very difficult topic of Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome, <br/>but  the  traumas  could  be  lead  to  second  order  effects.  Apart  from  threats  from  returning  foreign <br/>fighters. <br/> <br/>Many countries of origin are also worried about support groups in their countries. That support the, <br/>the jihad in Syria and other places from their homes by way of financing it, or recruiting people, or <br/>being  part  of  the  propaganda  machine.  And  also  they're  worried  about  the  possibility  that  these <br/>groups  will  further  radicalize  and  accept.  Intimidation  of  violence  as  a  legitimate  instrument  or <br/>course of action against the government. Or against perceived unbelievers or not good Muslims. For <br/>instance, those who speak out,  against  the jihad and especially, against IS or against  other groups. <br/>They're  also  worried  about  the  Sunni/Shia  clashes  within  their  countries.  But  also  think  of <br/>polarization  within  society  because  of  what's  happening  in  Syria  and  Iraq.  These  horrible  pictures <br/>that of people committing murder in the name of Islam. And it real, it leads to a lot of anti-Muslim <br/>feelings,  and of  course  doesn't  make  the  situation of  Muslims  in  non-Muslim  countries  any  easier. <br/>And we have seen this also in the town of The Hague where we, where youngsters have been waving <br/>the IS flag and have congratulated IS with the, the conquering of Mosul, the city in Iraq. And at the <br/>same time we've had demonstrations of right-wing groups that strongly reject the idea of. Or, or this <br/>perception  of  Islam  taking  over  certain  neighbourhoods.  So  we've  seen  already  these  clashes.  Call <br/>them clashes of civilization at the local skill, but they are important as well and worry a lot of local <br/>officials.  <br/> <br/>If I have to look at the threat post by foreign fighters to countries of origin, I see that many home <br/>countries  have  a  very  home-centric  view,  a  too  home-centric  view.  The  folks  has  mainly  only <br/>returning four and five and I think that's too narrow. It makes sense because these governments are <br/>primarily  responsible  for  the  security  in  their  territory  jurisdiction.  But  I  think  their  citizens  cause <br/>serious problems outside these countries. In Syria and Iraq. And they are part of, of, of war crimes in <br/>these  countries  and  the  presence  of  these  foreign  fighters  makes  future  settlements  far  more <br/>complicated. [SOUND] And they've threatened aid workers, they've threatened journalists. And they <br/>are a threat to stability in the region as a whole. And finally, many foreign fighters will not return to <br/>their  countries  of  origin,  partly  because  their  passports  have  been  taken  away.  For  many  reasons, <br/>because  they  fear  prosecution.  So,  they  go  to  other  countries  and  might  one  day  settle  down <br/>somewhere,  hopefully,  peacefully.  But  they  also  might  move  on  to  the  next  fight,  continuing  this <br/>violence in the region. So, we have to be very worried about that as well.  <br/> <br/>To summarize the threat posed by foreign fighters: there are many different ways to look at it. It's, <br/>it's a huge, they have a huge impact in Syria and Iraq but they also have an impact on primarily the <br/>social peace and inter-group relations in their countries of origin. And allow to me to add and stress <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6_8></a>the  fact  that  have  caused  a  lot  of  death  and  misery  in  Syria  and  Iraq.  And  yes,  there  has  been <br/>incidence  and  attacks  in  countries  of  origin.  But  if  you  compare  the  two,  the  deadliness  of  this <br/>phenomena is in Syria and Iraq. Well, and I, if I have to sum up the threat posed by foreign fighters to <br/>the countries of origin I would not stress the physical impact but I would stress the impact on social <br/>peace and inter group relations. In the next, video we will explore some policy options. To deal with <br/>the very complex phenomenon of foreign fighters. <br/> <br/><b>6.5 POLICY OPTIONS <br/> <br/></b>Hi there. In the last video we discussed the threat posed by foreign fighters. And in this video we will <br/>explore some policy options to deal with this phenomenon. What can the world do about the threat <br/>posed by foreign fighters? Well, in week four of the course we discussed the need and opportunities, <br/>and also the obstacles of a holistic or comprehensive approach. And we came to the conclusion that <br/>it's  easier  said  than  done.  While  that  might  be  true.  But  looking  at  the  situation  in  Syria,  Iraq  and <br/>elsewhere, doing nothing is not an option. We have to do something. We have to learn very quickly <br/>to  deal  with  the  threat  posed  by  foreign  fighters  and  other  groups  in  these  areas.  We  need  an <br/>answer. Doing  nothing  is not  an option.  And  in  this  video,  we would  like to  see  if the  UN  strategy <br/>could serve as a guideline. Well, what does this UN strategy look like? What measures does it consist <br/>of?  <br/> <br/>Well,  basically  four  types.  The  four,  the  first  type  of  measures  are  measures,  to  address  the <br/>conditions  conducive  to  the  spread  of  terrorism.  And  a  second  set  of  measures  are  measures  to <br/>prevent and combat terrorism. The third category are measures to build states' capacity to prevent <br/>and  combat  terrorism,  and  to  strengthen  the  role  of  the  UN  system  in  this  regard.  And  finally.  It <br/>consists of a set of measures to ensure respect for human rights for all. And the rule of law as the <br/>fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism. Let us have a look at each of these categories, the <br/>first  category,  measures,. To  deal  with  the  conditions  conducive  to  the  spread  of  terrorism.  What, <br/>does  the  UN  documents  say  about  this?  They  have  a  long  list  of,  individual  measures  and  I  think <br/>these three are among the most important ones.  <br/> <br/>First, to promote dialogue and tolerance and prevent defamation of religion, religious values, beliefs <br/>and cultures. Well, that's very important. In the previous video, I mentioned the indirect impact of <br/>foreign fighters and what's happening in Syria and Iraq on intra and interfaith relations. Also linked it <br/>to what some believe to be a clash of civilizations, anti-Muslim feelings. Now, we have to be careful <br/>about  that.  And  measures  to  promote  dialogue  and  debate  and  tolerance  might  help  to  limit  that <br/>impact.  Then  the  second  issue.  To  ensure  for  realization  of  the  development  goals  including  the <br/>Millennium  Development  Goals.  They  relate  to.  Poverty,  health  larger  issues  like  that,  social <br/>economic  issues.  Well,  in  week  three  we  discussed  the  link  between  poverty  and  terrorism.  And  I <br/>believe there's no direct link. But the UN thinks that these larger conditions, these conditions that re, <br/>which relate to. Health education and, and poverty. There is a link with terrorism. And they believe <br/>that in the long run, it might lead to less terrorism. But it's not a short term measure. Then to scale <br/>up cooperation and assistance in the field of rule of law, human rights, and good governance. And I <br/>think the latter is very important. The good governance element. We should do more about that. If <br/>you look at the Arab Spring, Arab Uprising, Arab Awakening in many of these countries, they were <br/>related to a lack of good governance  if you could say that. And also in Syria,  the  Syrian uprising is <br/>linked to that and if we could do more about good governments in, many of these countries to deal <br/>with corruption etcetera. That in the long run might have an impact as well lead to less terrorism.  <br/> <br/>Then measures to prevent and combat terrorism. Four issues stand out, refrain from facilitating and <br/>financing  or  tolerating  terrorist  activities.  Well  especially  the  financing  part  is  important.  Many <br/>believe that IS got a lot of support from a number of countries and a number of individuals, in the <br/>past, and that made it possible for this organization to grow and become very strong. And recently, a <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6_9></a>lot of policy makers and governments have said, we have to stop this. And that could even have an <br/>impact  on  the  medium  term.  Then  to  ensure  that  territories  are  not  used  for  terrorism  training <br/>camps or the preparation of terrorism acts. Well of course that makes a lot of sense. And if you could <br/>do more about that that could even have a short term impact. Then to ensure the apprehension and <br/>prosecution or extradition of perpetrators of terrorist acts. So apprehension and extradition. I believe <br/>that's very relevant in the case of foreign fighters. Many of them of course don't fly directly into Syria <br/>or  Iraq  but  cross  many  different  borders  also  that  of  neighbouring  countries.  These  neighbouring <br/>countries  face  a  lot  of  troubles  with,  with  refugees  but  they  might  or  they  could  do  more  in <br/>apprehending foreign fighters preventing them to cross the border into Syria. And extradite them to <br/>their countries of origin. Again that's also easier said than done. But more is needed in this field. And <br/>then  finally  to  combat  illicit  arm  trades  that  makes  a  lot  of  sense.  Of  course  we  have  to  do  more <br/>about that. Again that could have even a short term or medium term impact.  <br/> <br/>Then  measures  to  build  state  capacity  and  to  measures  that  relate  to  the  role  of  the  UN.  Well  to <br/>contribute  to  the  capacity  building  programs  in  the  area  of  port  and  civil  aviation  security  is  an <br/>interesting measure, especially in relation to civil aviation security. In the last months and last year <br/>groups like Islamic State and other groups have again threatened the airline industry. Which worries <br/>a  lot  of  people  that,  that,  that  fly.  And  more  could  be  done,  could  be  done  to  improve  security. <br/>Perhaps not in a number of, of countries  but  in some other countries. We  could do more to make <br/>that even safer. And then, to encourage frequent exchanges of information and technical assistance <br/>among  bodies  dealing  with  counter  terrorism.  A  lot  could  be  learned  from  different  countries  can <br/>learn a lot from each other. Best practices, but also worst practices. And the best way to learn is not <br/>to find out yourself what you do wrong, or what is successful, but to sit around a table and to share <br/>ideas,  experience,  etc.  That  could  have  some  impact  on  the  medium  term,  and  then  to  cooperate <br/>with  other  organisations  such  as  the  World  Bank,.  Think  about  think  of  money  laundering,  and <br/>terrorism financing, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime.  <br/> <br/>Then the final category. The measures to ensure respect for human rights, and rule of law. Well some <br/>of the measures mentioned, or the issues mentioned in the UN strategy. Are you could say a good <br/>advice to governments. To make sure that there's effective counter-terrorism policy. But that these <br/>counter  terrorism  measures  and  the  protection  of  human  rights  are  not  conflicting  goals.  But <br/>complimentary and mutually enforcing. They go hand in hand. It's not. Human Rights, or security but <br/>they have to they are one of the, of the same. You cannot have a lot of security while not respecting <br/>human rights. And then counter terrorism measures need to comply with international law. <br/> <br/>And a final point I would like to make. Perpetrators have to be brought to justice. And I think if we <br/>see the images, the horrible images in Syria, and Iraq and many other parts of the world. I think the <br/>family of the victims and the victims themselves, need to know, and be sure about the, the idea that <br/>their perpetrators. Will be brought to justice. How to translate these ideas into concrete measures <br/>and to implement them effectively. Well, this is difficult, and takes us back to week four, where we <br/>discussed,  the  pros  and  cons,  the  possibilities  and  obstacles.  To  a  comprehensive  or  holistic <br/>approach.  And  we  said  it's  easier  said  than  done.  And  this  is  also  the  case  with  regard  to  the  UN <br/>strategy. But nonetheless, it's highly valuable for a long term approach. But in the short term, it will <br/>not stop the fighting. And it will not immediately stop the flow of foreign fighters going to Syria and <br/>Iraq.  Today  the  military  option  is  the  predominate  one.  And  also  that  will  not  bring  the  solution. <br/>Might  have  an  impact  on  the  short  term,  but  it  will  not  be  the  solution.  Ideally,  we  would  find  a <br/>proper mix between short term measures and long term measures. That also focus on the conditions <br/>that led to the rise of groups like Islamic State, Jabhat al-Nusra, and other groups.  <br/> <br/>To  sum  up,  there  are  several  theoretical  options  to  deal  with  foreign  fighters.  And  the  UN  Global <br/>Counter-Terrorism  Strategy  lists  a  number  of  these  measures  in  four  different  categories.  But  the <br/>problem of these measures is that they mainly relate to the medium and long run. And in the short <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6_10></a>run, there are fewer options. And this means we should not expect any solutions soon. And as many <br/>have already indicated, the situation in Syria and Iraq will not be solved in a few months time. It will <br/>take years, unfortunately. <br/>  <br/>
