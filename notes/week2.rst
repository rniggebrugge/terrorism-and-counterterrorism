- decline in academic interest


post 9/11, 2001
---------------

- enormous growth in scholars and experts
- new centres
- policy advice and consultancy in demand as response to 9/11
- growth in publications


Disciplines and approaches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Variety of disciplines
----------------------

- political science
- military science
- international relations
- communication studies
- (social) psychology


And many more disciplines. Many scholars have background in political science.


How to study terrorism?
-----------------------

- behavious of individuals or world political systems?
- talk to people or look at facts?
- causes or effects of terrorism?


Main approaches
---------------

1. Rational or instrumental approach (broad look)
2. (Socio) psychologists (individuals and groups)
3. Multicausal approach: complicated matter, you need to look at wide variety of aspects


Main academic journals
----------------------

- Studies in Conflict and Terrorism
- Intelligence and National Security
- Terrorism and Political Violence
- Critical Studies on Terrorism
- `Perspectives on Terrorism <http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot>`_


Main difficulties
-----------------

- no general accepted definition of terrorism: how to compare results of studies using different definitions?
- subjective and politicised
- small numbers: difficult to give high assurance for hypothesises
- complex and ever-changing
- Most important problem: **Secrecy**



Issues related to secrecy:

* interviewing people: talk
* participant observation: join
* access to files and archives: consult
* ethical problems: accusations of being one-sided, biased
* reliability and validation: how reliable, how to validate?



Researcher **Jessica Stern** managed to talk to imprisoned (former) terrorirst. The book *Terror in the Name of God* is the result of many interviews she held with these prisoners.



Main characteristics of current research on terrorism
-----------------------------------------------------

- main focus on niches: lot of attention on incidents that relatively cause few damage and harm
- based on assumption terrorism is a big threat, but this is not true for (most) Western countries
- few comparative studies and few theory testing
- selection bias to western interests
- policy oriented nature: focus on how to deal with threats, what policies to implement
