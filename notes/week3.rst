Five Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Terrorism is caused by poverty
2. Terrorists are crazy
3. Terrorism is increasingly lethal
4. Terrorism is predominantly anti-western
5. Terrorism is successful


First Assumption
----------------

The assumption that poverty triggers terrorism is almost as old as the first attempts to understand terrorism.

- mostly put forward by politicians and public figures
- stated by Colin Powell, US Secretary of State
- and by Desmond Tutu, Archbishop South Africa


Are they right are wrong? And why is it assumed?

- poverty leads to lack of opportunities
- anger towards people that are better of
- blaming government
- grievances
- violence as last resort to put something on the political agenda
- perceived correlation between poverty and terrorism, as terrorism occurs often in poor countries
- some left-wing terrorist groups claim to fight for the poor


Why does it matter?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- clear implications for counterterrorism
- if true, CT-efforts should be aimed at eradicating poverty
- allocating scarce resources, so spend it to fight the causes of terrorism


It is mainly politicians that make the claim. A causal link sounds reasonable.



Empirical evidence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Characteristics of some individual terrorists:

- Osama bin Laden: from right Saudi family
- Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, so-called Christmas Day Bomber: tried to bomb a plane heading for Detroit in 2009. He was from a well-to-do Nigerian family and studied in London
- Anders Breivik
- Ulrike Meinhof (Rote Armme Fraktion): from good family
- Jihadi terrorists in Europe: mainly from migrants or migrants. From lower parts of society, but not poorer than other immigrants
- Terrorists in the developing world: certainly not poorer than their fellow citizens



Look at countries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 

High impact countries:

- Iraq
- Afghanistan
- India
- Russia
- Nigeria


World Bank, GDP per capita 2012:

- Iraq, upper middle income
- Pakistan: lower middle income
- Nigeria: lower middle income
- Russia: high income
- Afghanistan: in bottom. But 15 countries are left developed
- 10 poorest countries have low impact from terrorism, exception: Congo


And in the past?

- Left-wing terrorism in 1960s and 1970: Germany, Italy, Japan
- were and are among richest countries in the world


Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^

Both when looking at individuals and countries there seems to be no evidence for a direct link between poverty and terrorism



Academic evidence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **James Piazza**: "Rooted in Poverty?: Terrorism, Poor Economic Development and Social Cleavages"
- terrorism at a macro-level
	- different defintions of poverty and different variables
	- example: low per capita income, high levels of illiteracy, low life expectancy, lack of employment opportunities
	- Conclusion: all these poverty-related variables cound **not be linked to terrorism**
- **Alan Krueger** and **Jitka Maleckova**:
	- link between poverty, education and terrorism
	- focus on the militant wing of Hezbollah
	- Conclusion: "Any connection between poverty, eduction and terrorism is indirecd, complicated and probably quite weak."
	- Response to political conditions and long-standing feelings of indignity and frustration
	- little to do with economics



Myth
^^^^

- No support for the idea of a direct link between poverty and terrorism
- indirect link: hard to prove
