Five Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Terrorism is caused by poverty
2. Terrorists are crazy
3. Terrorism is increasingly lethal
4. Terrorism is predominantly anti-western
5. Terrorism is successful


First Assumption
----------------

The assumption that poverty triggers terrorism is almost as old as the first attempts to understand terrorism.

- mostly put forward by politicians and public figures
- stated by Colin Powell, US Secretary of State
- and by Desmond Tutu, Archbishop South Africa


Are they right are wrong? And why is it assumed?

- poverty leads to lack of opportunities
- anger towards people that are better of
- blaming government
- grievances
- violence as last resort to put something on the political agenda
- perceived correlation between poverty and terrorism, as terrorism occurs often in poor countries
- some left-wing terrorist groups claim to fight for the poor


Why does it matter?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- clear implications for counterterrorism
- if true, CT-efforts should be aimed at eradicating poverty
- allocating scarce resources, so spend it to fight the causes of terrorism


It is mainly politicians that make the claim. A causal link sounds reasonable.



Empirical evidence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Characteristics of some individual terrorists:

- Osama bin Laden: from right Saudi family
- Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, so-called Christmas Day Bomber: tried to bomb a plane heading for Detroit in 2009. He was from a well-to-do Nigerian family and studied in London
- Anders Breivik
- Ulrike Meinhof (Rote Armme Fraktion): from good family
- Jihadi terrorists in Europe: mainly from migrants or migrants. From lower parts of society, but not poorer than other immigrants
- Terrorists in the developing world: certainly not poorer than their fellow citizens



Look at countries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 

High impact countries:

- Iraq
- Afghanistan
- India
- Russia
- Nigeria


World Bank, GDP per capita 2012:

- Iraq, upper middle income
- Pakistan: lower middle income
- Nigeria: lower middle income
- Russia: high income
- Afghanistan: in bottom. But 15 countries are left developed
- 10 poorest countries have low impact from terrorism, exception: Congo


And in the past?

- Left-wing terrorism in 1960s and 1970: Germany, Italy, Japan
- were and are among richest countries in the world


Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^

Both when looking at individuals and countries there seems to be no evidence for a direct link between poverty and terrorism



Academic evidence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **James Piazza**: "Rooted in Poverty?: Terrorism, Poor Economic Development and Social Cleavages"
- terrorism at a macro-level
	- different defintions of poverty and different variables
	- example: low per capita income, high levels of illiteracy, low life expectancy, lack of employment opportunities
	- Conclusion: all these poverty-related variables cound **not be linked to terrorism**
- **Alan Krueger** and **Jitka Maleckova**:
	- link between poverty, education and terrorism
	- focus on the militant wing of Hezbollah
	- Conclusion: "Any connection between poverty, eduction and terrorism is indirecd, complicated and probably quite weak."
	- Response to political conditions and long-standing feelings of indignity and frustration
	- little to do with economics



Myth
^^^^

- No support for the idea of a direct link between poverty and terrorism
- indirect link: hard to prove



Second Assumption: Terrorists are crazy
---------------------------------------


Logic behind it is simple. 

- How can a sane person commit ats of terrorism?
- Difficult to understand the person
- Especially with suicide attacks
- He/she must be insane


Terrorists are crazy:

- Acts evoke moral outrage, making it difficult to form an objective judgment
- Comparison to mass murders and school shooters
- Difference:
	- Political motivation
	- Rationality -> not crazy, irrational
- Understanding does not mean condoning
- Crazy/sane are subjective concepts

But though it is difficult to understand how and why terrorists come to their deeds, they are mostly 'normal' people.

Why is it important to answer the question.

- implications for counterterrorism
- more cooperation with actors in mental healthcare
- little we can do
- why investigate motivations and rationale if they are crazy?


Academic evidence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Terrorism is a rational behaviour making terrorists rational actors that kill to achieve certain political goals
- (Socio-)psychological approach: more or less consensus that they are not crazy
- *Jerrold Post*: "..., terrorist groups and organizations regularly weed out emotionally unstable individuals. They represent, after all, a security risk."
- *Louise Richardson*: "There is no particular terrorist personality"
- *Ehud Sprinzak*: "rational fanatics"


But from the other side:

- this does not mean no terrorist is clinically psychotic
- personality disturbances might be more frequent
- difficulty diagnosing terrorists, they are not available!



Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^

The assumption that Terrorists are crazy is **false**.



Third Assumption: Terrorism is increasingly lethal
--------------------------------------------------

Two interpretation:

- more fatalities in general
- more fatalities per attack


Origin of clain:

- terrorism is defining feature of our age
- post 9/11 world
- terrorism is regarded as a very big threat


Politicians and scholars supporting the assumption:

- **Dick Cheney**: biological agents, nuclear weapon, chemical weapon, all possible weapons
- Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: weapons at the terrorists' disposal is wide and increasing
- **Peter Neumann** (scholar): in the era of the new terrorism the two considerations - violence and symbolic value - seem to have merged, with mass-casualty attacks against civilian population being routine and intentional...
