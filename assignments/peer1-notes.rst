Oklahoma City bombing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verdict of the judge
--------------------

In the verdict of the judget the words *terrorism* or *terrorist* were not used to refer to
either to the perpetrator or the his acts. The perpetrator is found guilty on the conspiracy
to use a weapon of mass destruction, the use of a weapon of mass destruction and on first degree
murder on 11 counts. 

12 core components
------------------

**1. it should say something about a doctrine and/or practice of violent action**

**2. it should refer to the context in which terrorism is employed as a tactic**

The act was carefully planned, from the fabrication of the bomb, the selection
of the governmental target and the eventual execution of the plan all show that
terrorism was employed as a tactic. 



**3. it should contain the concept of physical violence of threat thereof**

**4. it should say something about threat-based communication processes**

**5. it should mention that terrorism instiils fear, dread, panic or mere anxiety**

**6. it should say something about the direct victims**

McVeigh considered assassinations of important individuals, among them Attorney Generals,
but eventually chose to destroy a federal building with the intention of killing a large
amount of people. The deaths of these people was meant as a message, clearly indicating the
difference between the direct and indirect victims.



**7. it should point at the fact that the direct victims are not the ultimate target**

The dectruction of the federal building and the death of the direct victims were merely instrumental,
not the goal in itself. 



**8. it should say something about the perpetrators**

**9. it should mention that terrorism is predominantly political**

There is a clear political intent, motivated by McVeigh's hatred of the US federal government,
with the handling of federal authorities of the Waco siege and Ruby Ridge incident as important
events that increased his anger. 

The target selection further confirms the political intent; the target should house at least two
of the agencies Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Furthermore the number of non-governmental
casualties was to be minimized.



**10. it should refer to the intent of acts of terrorism**

**11. it should contain the motivations to engage in terrorism**

**12. it should mention that terrorist acts form part of a campaign of violence**
